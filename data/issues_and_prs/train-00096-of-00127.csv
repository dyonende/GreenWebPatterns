I ended up turning your sample into a PowerShell function called `Get-AppVeyorArtifacts` for my eventual use but which is generally reusable:

```ps1
function Get-AppVeyorArtifacts
{
    [CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess = $true, ConfirmImpact = 'Low')]
    param(
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [string]$Account,
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [string]$Project,
        [parameter(Mandatory = $true)]
        [string]$Token,
        [string]$DownloadDirectory,
        [switch]$Flat,
        [string]$Proxy,
        [switch]$ProxyUseDefaultCredentials)

    $apiUrl = 'https://ci.appveyor.com/api'

    $headers = @{
        'Authorization' = ""Bearer $token""
        'Content-type' = 'application/json'
    }

    # Prepare proxy args to splat to Invoke-RestMethod

    $proxyArgs = @{}
    if (-not [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($proxy)) {
        $proxyArgs.Add('Proxy', $proxy)    
    }        
    if ($proxyUseDefaultCredentials.IsPresent) {
        $proxyArgs.Add('ProxyUseDefaultCredentials', $proxyUseDefaultCredentials)
    }

    $downloadDirectory = @($downloadDirectory, '.')[[string]::IsNullOrEmpty($downloadDirectory)]
    $errorActionPreference = 'Stop'

    $projectObject = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri ""$apiUrl/projects/$account/$project"" `

    $artifacts = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri ""$apiUrl/buildjobs/$jobId/artifacts"" `
                                   -Headers $headers @proxyArgs
    $artifacts `
    | ? { $psCmdlet.ShouldProcess($_.fileName) } `
    | % {

        $type = $_.type

        $localArtifactPath = $_.fileName -split '/' | % { [Uri]::UnescapeDataString($_) }
        if ($flat.IsPresent) {
            $localArtifactPath = ($localArtifactPath | select -Last 1)
        } else {
            $localArtifactPath = $localArtifactPath -join [IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar
        }
        $localArtifactPath = Join-Path $downloadDirectory $localArtifactPath

        $artifactUrl = ""$apiUrl/buildjobs/$jobId/artifacts/$($_.fileName)""
        Write-Verbose ""Downloading $artifactUrl to $localArtifactPath""
            
        Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $artifactUrl -OutFile $localArtifactPath @proxyArgs

        New-Object PSObject -Property @{
            'Source' = $artifactUrl
            'Type'   = $type
            'Target' = $localArtifactPath 
        }
    }
}
```

A sample usage would be:

```ps1
Get-AppVeyorArtifacts ACCOUNT PROJECT -Token TOKEN -Flat `
    -DownloadDirectory $env:Temp `
    -Proxy http://proxy.example.com:8080/ -ProxyUseDefaultCredentials 
```

Please send an email to `info@devopsdays.org` with the names and email addresses of the folks who are on your organizing committee. Please also update the `data/events/2020-zurich.yml` in this PR with those names under the `team_members` section.

I will propose the change myself for this one - but we have collapsed email aliases to make things easier. The email address for the event will be `zurich@devopsdays.org`

username_0: Greetings,

I would like to suggest to add more team members to the rss-bridge team.

There are currently 5 members: @ArthurHoaro @mitsukarenai @teromene @LogMANOriginal and @username_3 

Independent of previous achievements and additions (and some of those team members have written most of the application) to rss-bridge, the only currently active team member is @username_3. Since 01-01-2021, only teromene (1 commit) and mitsu (2 commits, same topic) have worked on rss-bridge at all, with arthur and logman having 0 commits.

In order to keep the software up to date and in a good state, I strongly suggest to add more members to take the load off of em's shoulders. 

Looking at the [list of contributors who added things to rss-bridge since the beginning of 2021](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge/graphs/contributors?from=2021-01-01&to=2022-03-21&type=c), this is the top 10 list:

1. @username_3 
2. @VerifiedJoseph 
3. @username_0 
4. @username_5 
5. @username_1 
6. @csisoap 
7. @username_6 
8. @theScrabi 
9. @username_4 
10. @somini 

I would suggest to give these people the opportunity to join the team (of course only if they want to :) ) to keep the project alive and well.

Thoughts from everyone involved (team members or contributors) please
<issue_comment>username_1: I'd love to help, but at the moment I can't even cope with the flow of issues on my own repositories 😕
<issue_comment>username_0: All good, this is purely as ""these should be given the opportunity to join"", nothing more :) If you dont want to, its totally fine :)

Also, this is a suggestion, doesnt mean the team is going to agree :D
<issue_comment>username_2: I've tried to make a dent in the right direction to modernize the codebase (mostly in form of comments, code reviews and architecture suggestions), but failed on the lack of motivation on the core team. I eventually gave up. Even contacting one of the team members was a challenge. So, if you need a helping hand, I am all in.
<issue_comment>username_0: I just think that, when people moved on to other things, the process of ""handing over to others"" didnt happen as well as it could. So if we can get a few more people who are active in the community to be able to drive the process forward, it would also motivate people like you again to contribute :)

Btw: I know that the Top10 thing is scewed because it only validates commits that are done, not PRs in progress. Just from my own open PRs, there are about 100 changed files in #2296 and 4000 added loc in #2494 . And even that number is scewed because its content that was present already and is just moved.

So the list isnt perfect, but I want to start somewhere.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_6 and @username_0, I plan to add you to maintainers. Before that I want to discuss in meet.jit.si some things about maintaining rss-bridge. Discussion will be recorded and pasted here.

Do you have time to discuss Today 23:59 UTC+5?

Link to discussion will be posted here or in official irc channel
<issue_comment>username_0: Hi,

Midnight UTC+5 is 8pm in my and username_6s timezone. So it would work for me.

Before we do this though, what about the other people on the list?
<issue_comment>username_3: You both seem to be more active than or others.
<issue_comment>username_4: I think this is a great idea. I would love to become a maintainer, but I only have limited time to contribute at the moment. In any case, I would definitely be happy to help in reviving old PRs and helping maintainers with the project.
<issue_comment>username_5: To be honest, I'm not sure that I will be able to help with the PR, I may lack knowledge about the project structure.
I may help to sort bugs if it's needed ?
<issue_comment>username_0: so @username_6 : date in 45 minutes? @username_3 link?
<issue_comment>username_6: I'm available at 7PM UTC which is in 30 mins.

<issue_comment>username_0: Alright, @username_6 and me are now also officially team members. Thanks to @username_3 for the intro.

<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 
A couple of thoughts about those conversions:

1. You could use `gofmt -r` to do the conversions, which would cope better with all expressions:

    gofmt -w -r 'assert.Equal(t, a, b) -> c.Assert(b, qt.Equals, a)'

2. The equivalent of `assert.Equal` is actually `qt.DeepEquals`, because `assert.Equal` uses `reflect.DeepEqual` under the hood.

3. You might want to convert `assert.X` to `c.Check` not `c.Assert` because the testify `assert` package does not call `t.Fatal` on failure. The counterpart of `c.Assert` is the [require package](https://godoc.org/github.com/stretchr/testify/require).

4. You can use `qt.HasLen` rather than `len` - that way you get nicer failure messages that show the actual content.
