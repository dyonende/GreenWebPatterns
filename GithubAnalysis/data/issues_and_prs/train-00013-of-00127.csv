username_0: ## Why Snacks?

Prevent a low blood sugar by providing quick energy refilling snacks in the form of sweets, baked goods and candy. Keep those hard working brains happy - either by choosing yourself what to get or just leave it up to us to find the right sugar-bombs!

## How does it work?

Last year we asked some food companies for offers and had the sponsor confirm that amount up front. Once the food was delivered on the day the sponsor pulled out the credit card and made all attendees happy by enabling them to making the blood sugar level catch up. 
And we tell you, they had will be happy ... [until they need more, at party at night][party].

username_0: 
<issue_comment>username_1: I really like the idea of having archetype support for taxonomies. That would be a very helpful feature.

Now, I've been playing more with taxonomies and I figured that having Hugo create taxonomy terms, and taxonomy pages for you, is really presents great advantages, for instance:

- It helps keeping your /content directory cleaner.
- No problems with Ugly/Pretty urls settings

So, what if the scaffolding generates the files in the data folder instead of the content folder?

The data folder it's also to hold content, just as a page. But the difference is that the metadata for a taxonomy doesn't really belong to a page. In my opinion should be easily retrievable from anywhere.

So... This is how I think that taxonomies could work:

Let's say you want to add metadata to the 'members' taxonomy

1. You create an archetype for taxonomies/members. 
2. You create default values with the generator: `hugo new taxonomies/members/default.yml`
3. You create a new member: `hugo new taxonomies/members/tom.yml`
4. When you access it via `.Site.Taxonomies.brands` you get the WeightedPages as usual, plus all the data contained in the data file.

What do you think about that? @username_0 @onedrawingperday ?
<issue_comment>username_0: If I understand you correctly, you're talking about adding functionality that already exists with `.GetPage` and use of an `_index.md`, no?
<issue_comment>username_1: Yes, but that would have been needed in case of putting the metadata in the /data folder
<issue_comment>username_2: I like both ideas, taxonomy archetype and the scaffolding. Scaffolding would be great for new users in general and would help people utilize more complex front matter types.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 at what point do you think that the taxonomy files generator should be triggered?

I think that you could use a terminal command like

`hugo generateTaxonomyFiles`

Or something like it. 

That can search for all your taxonomies, terms and generate all files if they don't exist. 

It could have a flag like -rewrite to rewrite any existing files.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 you have many good ideas, but keep in mind that I'm the only non-dev on this team, so I'm just looking for feedback on whether this type of feature is worth it. Then I have to make a polite and respectful appeal to the rest of the team if users think it's worth it. And _then_ it's up to the devs as to opening a discussion about _how_ we implement :smile:

I'm just trying to discuss more on how this could be a useful feature. The problem now is that even when you can scaffold your taxonomy term pages, you have to do it one by one.

If you can generate all files in batch, with one command, that's powerful!
<issue_comment>username_3: I have a few concerns about this approach:

1. It assumes there are a _large number of taxonomy terms_, which I think is an anti pattern.
2. and assuming you have a large number of terms, a generator should support a rather complex life cycle to be really useful (new, changed, deleted terms), which is hard to get right

I have always thought that we, somehow, would get content in Hugo that would not be in the form of single markdown files, i.e. a product dump from a database etc. Taxonomy content would fit nicely into that thought, the idea being that the content files we have today would be merged with content generated on-the-fly from a set of ""page listing definitions"".
<issue_comment>username_1: That would be ideal. It sounds like how middleman creates dynamic pages from yml databases. That is very useful and flexible. If that is on the roadmap... or at least, in the conversation for long term plans, it's great news. And I agree, that would require a completely different approach.
<issue_comment>username_3: We have at least one other issue discussing this. So, it may not be on the ""road map"" (which is outdated and should probably be removed), but it is definitively on my mental road map.
<issue_comment>username_0: Agreed. Too many files is impractical, and markdown is a syntax and not a strategy. I'm not sure how a project like Hugo can control for this type of user behavior though, either.

I appreciate your time üôá @username_3
<issue_comment>username_4: I understand that this proposal is more broader than #3088, because it rightly considers authors as just another content instead of configuration.

As such, I would personally prefer to keep this issue as compared to the #3088.

Again, this is based on my limited understanding, and could be wrong.

<issue_comment>username_1: What do we really want to do with that? 

I check about log structuration and the thing that come back the most is [The elastic suite](https://www.elastic.co/fr/products), which is `logstach + elasticsearch + kibana`. It read and parse your log files to json and send them to elasticserach, then kabina (the analytics dashboard) query the logs you've send to elasticsearch to render charts with your data.

My questions : 

* Do we really want to install such a huge stack
* Do we really need all these features ?
* Can we write our own and simpler stack for this kind of work?

The good point is that we could use that to check the number of view of a n article or a page without having an update query on every request, but we could also do it in javascript / ajax to avoid the update query.
<issue_comment>username_0: Will you also investigate what Heroku add-ons there are that might help us with this kind of thing please?

No Food, no craftsmanship! Even the best people/coder need a full stomach - help us get some delicious energy-restorings for our guests. Of course as a sponsor you can either have a say in what to serve or you can leave it completely up to us to choose the right developers nutriment. And last year we got them all fed, so it's not as hard as it sounds :).

## How does it work?

We need about 800,- (8,- pP)

Last year we asked some food companies for offers and had the sponsor confirm that amount up front.

<issue_comment>username_1: Have you tried increasing the memory that you allocate with the nodejs process?

Something like this might help for large sites:`NODE_OPTIONS=""--max-old-space-size=8192""`
<issue_comment>username_0: Tried changing the `start` script with `node --max-old-space-size=8192 node_modules/@docusaurus/core/bin/docusaurus start`.
But the process still freezes at 21%.

Also a note comes up:
```
[BABEL] Note: The code generator has deoptimised the styling of \docs-site\docs\appendix\tpsr.md as it 
exceeds the max of 500KB.
```
<issue_comment>username_0: hey @username_1 - yes increasing the memory allocated seems to work!

But due to the file [tpsr.md](https://github.com/zowe/docs-site/blob/master/docs/appendix/tpsr.md) having around 23k lines of nearly 4MB is causing the app server to freeze at a certain percentage. Without this particular file the app is running as well as building fine.
<issue_comment>username_1: We use MDX to parse the markdown content and transform it into React components. 

Unfortunately, it is probably difficult to process a file of that size, but there might be other ways to create that page?

If the content is pure markdown, we'll enable later to provide an alternate md parser (https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3018), which may be more memory efficient (but also more limited due to the inability to use React inside markdown).


Why does this page need to be so long in the first place? Can it be splitted into multiple pages? Is the content auto-generated?

My feeling is that this page is autogenerated, and generating markdown might not be the best solution in the first place. I would rather:
- generate the table data as a json file
- create a `TsprTable` React component, importing that json file and rendering the table in plain React
- Use `<TsprTable>` inside the `tspr.md` file, leveraging the power of MDX
<issue_comment>username_2: Will this alternative md parser be the key to make Docusaurus v2 available for large doc site? Or is there any other workaround?

I've met similar problem when switching docusaurus v1 to v2. I have a very, very huge doc site (containing 7000+ md files, auto-generated by *.d.ts as api file). Docusaurus v1 generates the doc site in about one or two minutes. But Docusaurus v2 is unable to generate. The process breaks with a strange error after one hour.

Docusaurus v2 has more amazing features than v1 (actually in my opinion v1 is only ""can-use"" but missing many configurations). So I'm really looking forward to switching to v2. With some effort, I've resolved the parsing error in md syntax. But stuck at compiling time.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_2 here we talk about a very large file, not a lot of small files.

Docusaurus 2 compiles each md file to a React component by default (with MDX), so this adds a bit of overhead if you don't need MDX, and allowing a less powerful parser can be useful but also make it easier to adopt for sites using commonmark and not willing to change the docs during the migration.

I suggest opening another issue dedicated to your specific problem. It will be hard to troubleshoot that without a repro that I can run. Note we already have a few very large sites on Docusaurus but yes built time is definitively a pain point (ex: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/index)
<issue_comment>username_3: Closing in favor of #4765. We should work hard on reducing memory / build time as I've heard many complaints about it.<issue_closed>"

### What version of Hugo are you using (`hugo version`)?

<pre>
$ hugo version
Hugo Static Site Generator v0.80.0/extended linux/amd64 BuildDate: unknown
</pre>

### Does this issue reproduce with the latest release?
Not tested.

### Issue
Hi, all.

After upgrading to version v0.80.0, there is an error:
```
start position out of bounds for x-byte string
```

I expected that `{{ substr ""foo"" 3 }}` gives me empty string, and this always works until v0.80.0.

I believe commit 64789fb5dcf8326f14f13d69a2576ae3aa2bbbaa caused this problem. It was
```golang
if start > len(asRunes) {
	return """", fmt.Errorf(""start position out of bounds for %d-byte string"", len(aStr))
```
before, and now:
```golang
if start > rlen-1 {
	return """", fmt.Errorf(""start position out of bounds for %d-byte string"", rlen)
}
```

Can removing ""-1"" fix this?

Thank you in advance, and happy new year!
<issue_comment>username_1: That error is expected because counting starts at 0, not 1. So the start position is actually out of bounds. That behaviour changed in 0.80.0 and is now the same way substr works in other languages. That it worked before was a bug ;). 

Is there a specific case where you would want an empty string to be returned? I would expect something like `{{ substr ""foo"" 0 0 }}` to do that trick. 

I am not sure if that is the updated version yet: https://gohugo.io/functions/substr/ - there was a PR for the documentation to fix up the explanations for the ""new"" substr handling some days ago.

<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0,
Sorry about the breaking change.  The previous substr implementation was pretty buggy.  We tried to ensure the new implementation matches PHP's substr.  After some looking around, various languages do this differently (empty string vs error).  I'm not dead set on keeping this error return, but I want a good argument for keeping the old behavior (other than it broke your site).

It's late here (power outage at work has me up at 3am), and I'm too tired to think clearly about this issue.  So, in the meantime...

Can you explain your use case?  How would you work around this issue?
<issue_comment>username_0: Thank you for your reply.

Sorry but I don't think it is related to where counting stars. The only difference is the valid bounds shrunk.

Sure I can explain my case:
I write
```
{{ $curr_page := . }}
{{ substr $curr_page.RelPermalink 4 }}
```
to get `example.html` from `/en/example.html`, then I combine it with
```
{{ range $.Site.Home.AllTranslations }}
    {{ .Permalink }}
```
to get, for example `/zh/example.html`. For the home page `/en/`, Hugo before 0.79.1 can successfully give me `/zh/`.

I am not familiar with Hugo, so I will be very happy and grateful if there is a better way to do so. Thank you in advance!

In my opinion, there is no harm to get an empty string rather than get an error. Besides, I really don't have any good argument for that. So what do other people think?

It is not in a hurry, so you can go to bed first. I am in China and it is six pm in the evening. We can listen to more others' opinions.
<issue_comment>username_3: PHP doesn't complain either, and we refer to the PHP implementation in our documentation. Try this:

I encountered this breaking change a couple of days ago. I had some code that grabbed everything after the first character of a string, and I didn't provide a special case to check if the string was only a single character.

This worked in 0.79, though it is arguably lazy coding:

```
{{- $firstWord := ""A"" -}
{{- $firstCharacter := substr $firstWord 0 1 -}}
{{- $remainingCharacters := substr $firstWord 1 -}}
```

Changes required for 0.80:

```
{{- $firstWord := ""A"" -}
{{- $firstCharacter := substr $firstWord 0 1 -}}
{{- $remainingCharacters := """" -}}
{{- if gt (len $firstWord) 1 -}}
  {{- $remainingCharacters = substr $firstWord 1 -}}
{{- end -}}
```
<issue_comment>username_0: Yes! You are right!!! Thank you very much. I tried PHP and Javascript, they all don't raise errors! Thank you very much! That must be a strong argument!
<issue_comment>username_2: Interesting.  I assumed from the PHP docs that substr returning `false` in that scenario would raise an error somewhere, but apparently it doesn't.  `echo false` prints an empty string in PHP (`echo true` prints `1`).  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

I think we can revert to the previous behavior by getting rid of the error and just returning an empty string.  I'll work on it.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_2, Thank you.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thank you. Do we go further? I mean cancel the bound and always return empty string when `START` is greater than string's length. Because, PHP, javascript, and python all do like this.
<issue_comment>username_2: PR #8115 submitted.  PTAL
<issue_comment>username_1: I know it's splitting hairs, but per PHP documentation out of bounds `substr` returns false, not an empty string. That's probably because in PHP I would like to know WHAT went wrong instead of just going with what's coming back (nothing) from what I've done.

<issue_comment>username_0: Just as @username_2 explained, `echo false` prints an empty string in PHP. See, <https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.string.php#language.types.string.casting>.

The PR LGTM. @username_2 , thank you for your work! And, @username_1 , @username_3 , thank you for your participating in the discussion!
<issue_comment>username_1: If it's about that casting anything into a string will print an empty string if it's not already a stringable variable. A lot of these tickets here in the issue tracker are about ""please don't throw an error if I do this"" and half of the other tickets are ""hugo is not throwing an error if I do this"". Looks like Golang has an issue with typing :) As long as it's documented it's good.<issue_closed>"
