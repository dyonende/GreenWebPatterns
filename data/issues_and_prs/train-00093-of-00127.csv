I have got the same problem.
This is due of the way zmq is named after compilation in the lib folder of vcpkg. 
Normall ""vcpkg.exe install czmq""  will create 2 files czmq and libzmq-mt-4_3_4. copy/past the last one and rename it to zmq, and it solving the issue."

username_0: **Description**

- We need section with list of logos and links to details about how given user uses Kyma on production

- We still need to work on the content and come up with as buzz-word free page as possible

- have most of the stuff also in main kyma repo readme, especially icons of productive users

<issue_comment>username_0: Another solution not touching all those would be using a shaderprocessor cache.
Would ""intercept"" any case falling out of the ""hash"" cache, but still the same exact shader program.
<issue_comment>username_1: What are the performance impact ? I am not sure it is significant for our usecase, do you have number else we can spend energy on something else.
<issue_comment>username_0: It's just a note upon gl trace reading "" animation + shadow computed each frame that can easily gives huge number of GL call state. 

Here's the math for numbers:

nb shader state change = nb submesh * nb lights 
instead of = nbsubmesh

In case of animated mesh it's shader state change cost + whole bone uniform upload cost.

Difficult to get number, unless digging/benchmarking by doing with/without the change...

What we know that it impact:

- impact shader compilation time (stuttering at loading: if animated &3 lights that gives 
Nb of shaders =  nb submesh * nb lights. That can be a lot of useless compilation
- fps impact. ( to determine need benchmark)
- ""gl call trace"" clearing 


Other shadow related performance fix:

-> Useless texture binding is also a big ""gl call trace"" problem in shadow casting.
Maybe have to benchmark null texture binding, or even try a new kind of attribute state ""Disabled Override"" that would prevent any binding at all of texture.

-> compute scenebounds once per shadowed scene instead of thrice when using same flags for node mask

username_0: chart labels can link to the browser page for sv + place

e.g. in the screenshot below, California --> https://datacommons.org/browser/geoId/06?statVar=Annual_Consumption_Coal_ElectricPower

<issue_comment>username_1: when it's a single place, those labels show the stat vars. In those cases, do we still want the labels to link to browser page for sv + place? I feel like it might be a little confusing if both the chips and those labels have the same text but link to different places?
<issue_comment>username_0: good point - for a single place, the legend should also be the place label for consistency. wdyt?
<issue_comment>username_1: I think that could be confusing for single place + multiple stat vars because the legend would just have that same place repeated multiple times? Maybe the legend could be ""{statvar} - {place}""
<issue_comment>username_0: i like that - maybe {statVar} ({place})

single place, n statvar --> link to stat var x place page, and label is {statVar} ({place})
multi place, multi statvar --> link to place page, label stays as {place}
<issue_comment>username_1: thinking about it, I think it makes more sense to do:

single statvar -> link to stat var x place page & label is {stat var} ({place})
multi statvar -> link to place page, label stays as {place}
<issue_comment>username_2: I feel click target to the graph browser is more helpful than the place page. If I want to know more about those stat vars of a place, the place page does not tell much (and have no way to find where they are..)

I wonder if we should have a simple page that shows a list of ""place stat var"" page links and the click target goes there. This would be much more helpful for debugging etc.

Another option is to allow the graph browser expand for multiple stat vars, which is doable given the recent changes. That will also help for debugging and seeing all the different charts for a given stat var (which is the most popular use of it).

When there is a single place, showing {stat var} {place} is a bit surprising as the place just feel redundant there. I still vote for just showing the stat var label. 

If there is concern on chip and label leading to different places. Maybe we should have a way to click from the stat var hierarchy to the stat var explorer when it is available. Since there is no chip in other tools anyway, and the function to explore the stat var information should belong to the hierarchy rather than the chart region?
<issue_comment>username_1: I agree that graph browser will be more helpful than the place page. 

I think the browser can already be expanded for multiple stat vars. Do you mean allowing the graph browser page to render with those stat vars already expanded when the user goes to a specific url?

I think chip and label having the same text but leading to different places would be confusing for the user. But we could think about how to click from the stat var hierarchy instead of the chip. Or maybe have a separate click target for going to the stat var explorer.
<issue_comment>username_0: Consider the case of a single place, but many stat vars ([example](https://autopush.datacommons.org/tools/timeline#place=geoId%2F06&statsVar=GenderIncomeInequality_Person_15OrMoreYears_WithIncome__LifeExpectancy_Person__Count_Person_PerArea__Median_Income_Person__Count_Person__dc%2Fc17kzp0zrfkq9)). As you scroll, the context of the place is easily lost, and each chart is no longer standalone. The stat var legend labels also become redundant with the chips.

I think linking to the graph browser page with the stat vars expanded sounds good. That sounds sufficient though, and hoping we don't need to make it more complicated if we can avoid it.
<issue_comment>username_2: Okay, using graph browser for all click targets sounds good. I am okay with the label name change, we can see how it looks like for more cases.
<issue_comment>username_1: ok, so:

single statvar -> link to stat var x place page & label is {stat var} ({place})
multi statvar -> link to place page with all stat vars expanded, label stays as {place}
<issue_comment>username_0: yea that sounds good!<issue_closed>"

<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 

What comes to my mind is: who is going to be responsible to add a event to the calendar. The final user?

Love the idea of using what's on the market like Google Calendar and integrate it to the website. This is something that a lot of people use and are familiar with so from that users perspective, it will be simple to use.

If the events are going to be posted by a power user, command line might work.

From our perspective, parsing the information of the event might be challenging if the user doesn't use a standard form (assuming we are not only going to capture the title, date and time of the event). So I am thinking that the user will add the event and much more details of it in the ""body"" of the calendar meeting.
