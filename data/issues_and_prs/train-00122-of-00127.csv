username_0: Building the DevOpsDays site on my laptop, when plugged in, kicks up the fan and takes over five minutes:
```
                   |  EN   
+------------------+------+
  Pages            | 7228  
  Paginator pages  |    2  
  Non-page files   |   74  
  Static files     | 8592  
  Processed images |    0  
  Aliases          |  489  
  Sitemaps         |    1  
  Cleaned          |    0  

Total in 311477 ms
```

Today I built it on a train ride, for which I kept the laptop in power save mode to conserve battery, which took 24 minutes:
```
                   |  EN   
+------------------+------+
  Pages            | 7228  
  Paginator pages  |    2

  Sitemaps         |    1  
  Cleaned          |    0  

Total in 1441323 ms
```

By removing events from 2018 and prior, the five minutes becomes just north of one:
```
                   |  EN   
+------------------+------+
  Pages            | 2903

  Sitemaps         |    1  
  Cleaned          |    0  

Total in 76134 ms
```

That said, one possible solution would be to prerender old events which would no longer change, and serve them as static assets rather than dynamically-generated content. Is there any interest in that solution? I'd be happy to build a tool that does it, and PR in the result of running it for 2018 and prior.

username_0: I noticed that the `greet_people` systems (both the foreach and the later query variation) compile and run just fine without the Person reference.

So: `fn greet_people(name: &Name)` `fn greet_people(time: Res<Time>, mut timer: ResMut<GreetTimer>, mut query: Query<&Name>)` work just like `fn greet_people(person: &Person, name: &Name)` and `fn greet_people(time: Res<Time>, mut timer: ResMut<GreetTimer>, mut query: Query<(&Person, &Name)>)`.

Is there a specific reason the author included the Person references here? It seems confusing to me.
<issue_comment>username_1: Yeah I knew this going into it. I wanted to illustrate the pattern of breaking up a ""traditional"" data structure into its core pieces (in this case the Person marker component and the Name component). I think including another system with `(&Dog, &Name)` would help illustrate the reuse and the value of the marker components. In this case, including ""Person"" in the query ensures we only run on entities with (Person, Name) instead of any entity with Name. 

However in practice to suppress the ""unused variable"" warning and reduce the amount of data accessed, we would actually write the query like this:
```rs
Query<With<Person, &Name>>
```
That runs on the same dataset, but only iterates over the Name components. I didnt use that approach  because I didnt want to over-complicate the query with `With` that early in the book.

I can definitely see how this is confusing. If you have suggestions let me know.
<issue_comment>username_0: Maybe there is an opportunity here to show this in the tutorial. I personally have a ""break things to learn things""-approach and find it very powerful and I feel like the tutorial is written with this mindset too.

So maybe introduce this ""bug"" by declaring an entity with a name component which we don't want to greet!<issue_closed>

book insisted that the punctuation had to be inside, even when it put a
period inside what we were telling the user to type on their keyboard.
Stupid. My new rule is that if the thing in quotes is not a complete
sentence, then there is no need to move any punctuation inside the trailing
quote. It also better handles cases like when the thing inside quotes is a
question, but what's outside is not (and vice-versa).

I've been using the new rule on my blog. It has been going for 9 years and
nobody has complained yet.
<issue_comment>username_1: I completely agree, Wm, and in my personal writing I follow that rule. But I also believe that we should follow the style guide whenever possible. If you'd like to change the style guide, I can connect you with the powers that be.

(That said, I usually end up writing around the problem.)

## Proposed solution
Hi All! Here is the first draft to the Resources Page. Let me know what you think. The idea is for the landing page to show the featured resources as default (not shown here) and then allowing users to select by either resource type (books, videos) and/or narrow search by typing specific key words on the search. They can also add new resources and up/down vote to help other users.  If you click on “New Resource” you can see the modal for adding one.

Isn\'t Sass enough?"". While quite similar in terms of features and syntax, they differ fundamentally in used paradigm.

Thus, in my opinion, it makes sense to support both.\r\n\r\n### Less in Hugo\r\n\r\nI think that the way Less is written makes it a good candidate for Hugo. Official Less implementation is pure JavaScript, with both CLI and programmatic API available. It is also possible to use environment-free function that takes file manager as a parameter [7].

### Less usage

Less is a second most popular CSS preprocessor [2]. Contrary to what some of the industry articles might state, Less is nowhere near dead, deprecated or obsolete. It's used in many projects [3], including notable examples like StackExchange design system [4], WeChat official UI kit [5] or earlier versions of TailwindCSS. 

### Less vs Sass

One could say: ""Why should we add support for another preprocessor? Isn't Sass enough?"". While quite similar in terms of features and syntax, they differ fundamentally in used paradigm. Sass is an imperative language (like JS), while Less is declarative (like CSS itself) [6]. Each of these languages may work better for different projects, taking into account project needs or developer preferences. Thus, in my opinion, it makes sense to support both.

### Less in Hugo

I think that the way Less is written makes it a good candidate for Hugo. Official Less implementation is pure JavaScript, with both CLI and programmatic API available. It is also possible to use environment-free function that takes file manager as a parameter [7]. That opens door to support Hugo's virtual union filesystem and offer the same powerful import resolution we have in `js.Build` since v0.78.0.

<issue_comment>username_1: Why not Stylus as well? At best, the option to choose between Scss, Sass, Less and Stylus would be nice. The ability to specify the preprocessor in the config.toml would be nice. The default could remain scss/sass. In the end it comes down to productivity. Different teams and people simply work faster and better with other preprocessors.
<issue_comment>username_2: Is there a solid **native Go** implementation?
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Unfortunately no. I'd definitely mention that 😉
<issue_comment>username_2: Yes, that's true. Your proposal is well written and your arguments are sound.

My take on integrating with these JS tools is that it needs to _do a thing that we have to have and there are no native options_.  PostCSS (purge css) and Babel (we added that pre ESBuild) may be two examples of that. As a side effect of PostCSS we got reasonable TailwindCSS support. 

The thing is, adding this stuff has cost. One thing is the performance, but also the integration/maintainance cost. You have no idea of the amount of gray hair I accumulated trying to make sense of how config/dependency loading worked (differently) between these tools :-)

I used LESS myself some years ago,  but you're the first (as I remember) who have asked for LESS support in Hugo, so I suspect we need more hands in the air (""I want, I want!"") before we can add it.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 I understand your position, that totally makes sense. Let's wait and see if there's more interest.

**To all readers:**
If you'd find Less integration into Hugo Pipes useful, please give a thumbs up to my original message. Please avoid commenting, unless you have something new to share (i.e. you're in the middle of writing a native Go compiler for Less 😛).
<issue_comment>username_3: scss no longer supports native either, so eventually someone will have to figure out how to wrap the nodejs ecosystem anyway.
<issue_comment>username_2: Not sure what you mean by this, but Hugo have support for both LibSASS and Dart Sass.
<issue_comment>username_3: Interesting. Didn't work the last time I tried on arm/linux. Will try again.
<issue_comment>username_3: Nope still doesn't work. Neither on Mac/arm (so all new apple devices).  if these are not supported, ignore my comment. Will be looking into forking then to add something native."

<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 If this is helpful with what it's outputting currently, then I can implement the `fid` and `lastModified` fields later. Those fields require data about the Drupal entity rather than just the file itself, so it's a little different and makes sense to do in a follow-up.
