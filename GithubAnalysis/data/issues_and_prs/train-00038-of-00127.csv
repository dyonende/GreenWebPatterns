username_0: An application developer should care about OpenTracing because it saves them time and energy when connecting the dots between their software dependencies and their Tracer / tracing system.

The new OT registry (:clap: :clap: :clap:, thank you @austinlparker!) is both a valuable tool for the application developer above, and also a nice way to ""show rather than tell"" about OpenTracing's purpose in the ecosystem. As such, I was thinking that we may want to make it more prominent in the design for opentracing.io per se. Right now we have registry-like elements below the hero area:

username_0: There's a way to use the Hugo page variables inside a literal block?

I have this in the header of the document:

```
---
title: Page test
author: me
email: me@me.com
orgname:  myself
---
```
And I have this in the body:
```
[source,bash]
....
# test {{% param orgname %}}
....
```
But this renders as:
```
# test {{% param orgname %}}
```
instead of:
```
# test myself
```
<issue_comment>username_0: @bep Which is the other issue with the same problem? There's a workaround to solve this?
<issue_comment>username_1: Using `fileTwo.adoc` directly without include seems also not rendering correctly, right? 

There might be a workaround, if you use AsciiDoc variables - but the substitution might not work within source sections:

```
:orgname: myself

This is {orgname}.

[source,bash]
....
# test {orgname}.
....
```
<issue_comment>username_0: If I access `fileTwo.adoc` directly works well.

The problem only happens with the include function. I can’t use AsciiDoc variables to solve this because I need some custom shortcodes.

Maybe we can take a look at the code where the shortcodes are processed @username_1 

Thanks for your help.
<issue_comment>username_1: You were right. It seems, that the Hugo replacement is done before AsciiDoc include. 

Please explain why you need this exactly. Personally I would try not to use Hugo metadata  in AsciiDoc sections, because these cannot be rendered e.g. in PDF or other output formats.

Therefore I usually try to create a minimal AsciiDoc file ìndex.adoc` or `_index.adoc` for encapsulating Hugo rendering. That file `includes` the documentation sections without any Hugo metadata. You can name `index.adoc` a kind of adapter. The advantage here is that you can reuse these sections for rendering in other output formats without any side effects. 

`index.adoc` - as kind of adapter for Hugo rendering:
```
---
title: Page test
orgname:  myself
---
:orgname: {{% param orgname %}}
include::fileTwo.adoc[]
```

`fileTwo.adoc` - this is pure AsciiDoc and can be also rendered in PDF:
```
[source,bash,subs=attributes+]
....
# test {orgname}.
....
```

I just found, that you can even use variables within AsciiDoc code blocks - see `subs=attributes+`. The AsciiDoc variable substitutions are very powerful.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 I’m using this functionality to load values from toml files. But you’re right, with this approach this shortcodes are not going to be replaced in PDF :’(

I’m going to create some custom extensions.

I was looking in the documentation but I don’t find the way to pass custom extensions to AsciiDoctor when I using in combination with Hugo.

There’s a way to do that?
<issue_comment>username_1: You can directly set AsciiDoc variables using the [attributes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/formats/#external-helper-asciidoc) arguments in `config.toml`:
```
[markup.asciidocext]
    extensions = ...
    workingFolderCurrent = true
    [markup.asciidocext.attributes]
        orgname = ""myself""
```

Doing that, you don't need Hugo metadata.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 thanks, I’m going to use this approach.

One question not related to the issue. There’s a way to call custom extensions from hugo?"

username_0: Was there discussion of sort ordering? Should we reverse sort by number of children, or sort alphabetically?

<issue_comment>username_1: I made the change in cl/383953895 before I went on vacation to order the Vertical SVGs by a displayRank property and the rest by alphabetic name. And in there I noted that we should disable the ranking in website: https://github.com/datacommonsorg/website/blob/8a46c54b560e6be4f69d6e6eb3516e3518824e92/static/js/stat_var_hierarchy/stat_var_hierarchy.tsx#L125-L141

For non-vertical SVGs the ranking should be alphabetical by name, but the ""Miscellaneous"" under Energy is a special-case to rename the special ""eia/Root"". I'll send out a fix for that...
<issue_comment>username_1: The ""Miscellanous"" ordering is because it is a special eia/ thing, and for it ""specialized_entity"" was missing. I've sent out cl/384701501 to fix that.

I'm reassigning the bug to Jennifer to drop sorting in the website code for verticals, and instead rely on the cache order, controlled by displayName property.  It is now as follows:

After merge this PR to master feel free to remove `dev-1.17-uk.1` branch, we would like work into https://github.com/kubernetes-i18n-ukrainian/website organization.

Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_1: That [preview](https://deploy-preview-20020--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/uk/) looks good @username_0!

The new localization needs at least 2 owners that speak Ukrainian well. Owners & reviewers must be members of the Kubernetes organization on GitHub.

It looks like this branch is close to being OK to merge. I saw a few nits: there are files in the branch still in English; the owners file does not look valid; and “Home” isn't localized in https://deploy-preview-20020--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/uk/docs/home/

However, I have a different concern; this one is less technical and more legal.
/hold
because I think this approach warrants further discussion.

:warning: **Take care** about several people contributing to a fork and then proposing a merge to [k/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website) :warning:

Accepting a commit into the fork does not mean that it is valid for this project. Prow checks for contributor license agreements; if the fork does not, then a merge from that fork may not be allowed. Maybe there's a case for revising those requirements but, as they stand, the requirement for a CLA is going to be an obstacle there.
<issue_comment>username_0: Sorry, what you mean? I don't see non-localized stuff in `/uk/docs/home` location.

##### About legal stuff.
IMHO, is distracting and if see to many small and big OSS projects, they have no this limitation, because when someone contributing to repo, they automatically agree with `LICENSE` file/section in `README.md` when start contributing in project, but Kubernetes need explicit signing. Well, OK.

In this PR, we have contribution of me (@username_0), @username_3 and @username_5. We all signed CLA so for this PR is is not problem.

##### 5. 
In future, we can work with [k/website](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/) `master` from our individual forks and use `kubernetes-i18n-ukrainian` org only [as issue tracker](https://github.com/kubernetes-i18n-ukrainian/website/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc) for sync our team. Because in orig repos too much issues, labels and other stuff that produce too much overwhelm to regular contributor.

In other hand, if I can add Prow bot to fork, I do it. 

---

##### 6.
P.S. Also, @username_2 propose separate `OWNERS` file changes from this PR into new PR and than merge `OWNERS` into master. Because now we, formally, have no any reviewers or owners for this PR.  
In the same time [localization doc](https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/localization/) said that `OWNERS` file is part of min requirement content that introduced by this huge PR. 
Maybe you have any suggestions on it?
<issue_comment>username_2: I'll let @username_1 speak on this as well, but the OWNERS file should be submitted (and merged) before the actual content (available in the specific language).

Right now, the prow bot can't assign this PR to any Ukrainian native language speakers.
<issue_comment>username_1: Because there are concerns here, I'm going to discuss them with approvers and make sure there's clear consensus (possibly existing, possible it's new discussion) on the policy and how to apply it.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_1 thanks for your comments!
Let me explain the issue with partially translated files. These are solely docs that refer to k8s features with links to the front page. We translated only the page title and short description to have them appear on the front page, in k8s features block. We thought to catch up with them after our localization effort is confirmed. If it's not ok to leave them this way, we can remove them for now.
<issue_comment>username_1: AIUI, for a minimum localization the left navigation on https://deploy-preview-20020--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/uk/docs/setup/ should also be showing as localized.
<issue_comment>username_0: But in other languages is not localized

https://deploy-preview-20020--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/ru/docs/setup/
https://deploy-preview-20020--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/pl/docs/setup/
https://deploy-preview-20020--kubernetes-io-master-staging.netlify.com/de/docs/setup/
<issue_comment>username_1: One more point. If people work in a fork, I've just realized that this becomes a barrier for new Kubernetes organization members: their contributions don't count towards the requirements for membership of the Kubernetes GitHub organization.

Now I've thought of that, I think that's possible a more important concern than the legal paperwork (which is still important).
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 we can also log bugs against the localizations that are missing those translations.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_1 would it be enough for the start to translate only the headers or do we need to translate the entire documents?
<issue_comment>username_1: I think there's a way to localize just the section headings. See for example https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/master/content/ko/docs/setup/production-environment/_index.md

This whole file is translated. If other files in that folder aren't localized, that's OK for an initial localization.
<issue_comment>username_3: Ok, thanks, got it.
<issue_comment>username_4: I am catching up on the details here.
The link to contributing a new localization:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/localization/#minimum-required-content
<issue_comment>username_0: I think, info about needed adding redirect  `/doc -> /doc/home` location need to be add into https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/localization. Here [commit example](https://github.com/kubernetes/website/pull/20020/commits/a9a9f1303a542d15706ef34dee20d39024d8a870#diff-08ff7dbbf8cd4b8cdcc5fa58f032a9c8R19)

Otherwise folks, when click on 'Documentation home link' it will go to not very useful page like this:
![](http://i.piccy.info/i9/0b6688a3271e2b1e5f236e9d3e28bd6e/1585754270/173988/1370499/Screenshot_from_2020_04_01_18_12_59.png)

Should I create an issue?
<issue_comment>username_1: Each new localization does need to add commit to put the redirect in place; see https://github.com/kubernetes/website/blob/dc2f94faf03a0a22d17222acecb22f7f09d64e7e/static/_redirects#L9-L20 for an example

Feel free to log an issue! https://github.com/kubernetes/website/issues/18686#issuecomment-574463926 might also be relevant.
<issue_comment>username_1: I suggest though that you rebase this PR against _master_ with `--rebase-merges` set, and squash out any corrections that you can.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 you mean `--preserve-merges` ?
<issue_comment>username_0: Done
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 can you please squash the commits as well.
<issue_comment>username_1: I don't recommend a full squash if that will destroy the merge history. If no merge is needed then a full squash is OK. If the incoming branch needs a merge in order to work (it normally shouldn't) then please retain the merge commit.

I'm happy to explain further.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 squashing the commits is a common practice, but not a hard requirement, so I'm fine with either option.

However, it's absolutely likely to have the commits history so clean as possible.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_2 SIG Docs recently switched the default merge strategy, so squashing is more important now. I would expect to see this PR squashed to the minimum number of commits. Apart from merges this PR should include only localization changes (to Ukrainian).
<issue_comment>username_2: +1, agreed.

So long as the essentials are in place and there are no howlers (major errors), it's OK to merge this even with snags not yet addressed. Let's focus on what needs to happen to get these commits into _master_.

Can this get another /lgtm? Is there anything left to address before that?

username_0: ### Intro

It ""looks like"" there is a bug in production with direct links/routing(?).

- only occurs on live/production sites
- no errors when running locally using yarn start
- also, all pages used as examples below work fine when accessing them through the site (start at landing page, then click-through using menu of in-site links)

### Reproducable Error A

1. Browse to https://pester.dev/docs/commands/Describe

Problem 1: no left side-bar
Problem 2: uppercase Describe is being lowercased

### Reproducable Error B

1. Browse to https://pester.dev/docs/contributing/introduction
2. Click on link ""How to File an Issue""

Problem: 404 error

### Versions

Redux Toolkit uses v0.35 which also has the same problem.

Try browsing to this link https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/getDefaultMiddleware. 

Ping @username_2
<issue_comment>username_1: Same error, the version is 2.0.0-alpha.40.
<issue_comment>username_2: Hmmm.  Agreed that something is definitely going on with that RTK link, but it seems like only a few pages are being affected.  I also tried it with a few Redux core docs pages like https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers , and they seem to work okay.

If I open that link, I do see the left sidebar very briefly, and then it hides itself.
<issue_comment>username_0: ## Help Needed

I am no pro, especially when it comes to the server side of Docusaurus. Hopefully this is enough information for someone to chip in and help solve this problem ❤️
<issue_comment>username_3: 1. This redirect does your hosting provider. Accordingly, this is not a D2 problem.
2. Use URL with trailing slash only.

Try installing this package locally https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve, build a website and run the `serve /build` command - everything will become clearer.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks for explaining this @username_3, I will invest the time to get make this clear/learn.

It would be great if this is indeed a hosting issue (Netlify in this case).

<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 I have created PR https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/2235. This patch should show the doc sidebar when going to the wrong URL path.
<issue_comment>username_0: Copied from a Netlify notification email:


## Will this impact my SEO?

No. Forwarding traffic to a new domain extension using a 301 redirect is a proven technique that search engines are well aware of. Your inbound links will not be affected. Your search engine rankings will not be affected.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_0: Confirmed as fixed in 2.0.0-alpha.41. Thanks @username_3 👏
<issue_comment>username_2: Can you clarify what the actual fix is?

I was seeing the issue with a Redux Toolkit alpha API page yesterday, and tried deploying `alpha.41`.  Afterwards, it looked like the behavior was basically the same.  The left sidebar flashes briefly, then disappears.

Example link:

https://deploy-preview-352--redux-starter-kit-docs.netlify.com/api/createEntityAdapter
<issue_comment>username_0: Are you sure you are running .41. 

In my case the PR mentioned above now adds the sidebar when netlify redirects

https://docusaurus-powershell.netlify.com/docs/commands/New-DocusaurusHelp

to 

https://docusaurus-powershell.netlify.com/docs/commands/new-docusaurushelp/
<issue_comment>username_2: Hmm.

I coulda sworn I did merge in `alpha.41` last night, but I was also doing it at 2 AM, and I see `alpha.40` at the tip of the current PR branch I'm working on:

https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/blob/9842933e6a04d7ad83ef32911129b25f0798ba53/website/package.json

Lemme check this again this evening and confirm.
<issue_comment>username_0: OK, I am seeing some issues with css not loading in the lowercase version atm but that could be my local browser. 

You might be able to reproduce if you open a new browser window and then pasting my lowercased URL https://docusaurus-powershell.netlify.com/docs/commands/new-docusaurushelp/
<issue_comment>username_0: Not happening when opening a **private** window.
<issue_comment>username_2: This does not appear to be solving the problem for the Redux Toolkit docs.  Example as of right now, on `alpha.41`:

https://deploy-preview-352--redux-starter-kit-docs.netlify.com/api/createAsyncThunk
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_2 I just made a small fix and deployed your website, so everything should be OK https://hardcore-hermann-669593.netlify.com/api/getdefaultmiddleware/
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3 I can only speak for my own website but v43 solved all issues. Thanks for the quick fix 💯
<issue_comment>username_2: This is still somehow _not_ working right, at least on a specific PR branch.

This version, from [the PR that added .43](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/369), works fine:

https://deploy-preview-369--redux-starter-kit-docs.netlify.com/api/getdefaultmiddleware/

I merged that PR to `master`, and then merged `master` into [a larger WIP PR with code changes](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit/pull/352).  However, _that_ version does _not_ work okay even after I merged in .43:

https://deploy-preview-352--redux-starter-kit-docs.netlify.com/api/getdefaultmiddleware/

Why are these not behaving the same?
<issue_comment>username_2: Scratch that last comment.

I just tried clearing the Netlify cache and forcing a redeploy, and _now_, finally, the PR 352 preview link looks correct:

https://deploy-preview-352--redux-starter-kit-docs.netlify.com/api/getdefaultmiddleware/

- Sidebar on left side even though we went straight to the page URL
- Page TOC on the right side
- Content is the correct width

So, I'm going to claim this is indeed good to go now.

Thanks for poking at this enough to fix things!
<issue_comment>username_0: Netlify users: **make sure to disable `PrettyURLs`** (as that will prevent lowercased URL redirects and added trailing slashes leading to 404s). See https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/2394#issuecomment-599039072"
