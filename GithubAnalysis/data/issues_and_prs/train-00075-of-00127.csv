Unable to start minikube on Windows 10

<!--Required Information-->
**Problem:**
minikube start     * minikube v1.2.0 on windows (amd64)
* Creating virtualbox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=2048MB, Disk=20000MB) ...
E0805 21:45:37.280907   22032 start.go:559] StartHost: create: precreate: VBoxManage not found. Make sure VirtualBox is installed and VBoxManage is in the path

X Unable to start VM
* Error:         [VBOX_NOT_FOUND] create: precreate: VBoxManage not found. Make sure VirtualBox is installed and VBoxManage is in the path

PS C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin> minikube start --vm-driver=VirtualBox                                              * minikube v1.2.0 on windows (amd64)
* Creating VirtualBox VM (CPUs=2, Memory=2048MB, Disk=20000MB) ...
* unsupported driver: VirtualBox

**Proposed Solution:**
Go to ""Hyper-V Manager"" in Windows. (Search from TaskBar)
Once in Hyper-V Manager go to ""Virtual Switch Manager"" on right panel
Select ""New Virtual Network switch""
Select ""External"" for Network Type
Select Create Virtual Switch (name the switch ""Primary Virtual Switch"")
Click Apply the OK

After that open Powershell as admin (I got error with cmd) and run command:

minikube start --vm-driver hyperv --hyperv-virtual-switch ""Primary Virtual Switch""

After that you just run: minikube start

To check that all is in order run:
minikube status
minikube ip

username_0: Hello, can someone tell me what's `GITHUB_READING_FILE`'s error about?
<issue_comment>username_1: It means that staticman can't get infos from your repository or read the staticman file. I bangged my head against the wall for a whole afternoon with this error, only to find out that I named my staticman file `staticman.yaml` instead of `staticman.yml`...

So check if the repository name you give to staticman is correct and that your staticman is properly named in your repository root.
<issue_comment>username_2: Think i'm stumbled on same weird error as @username_0 . Definitely have properly named `staticman.yml` config file. Not sure what this can mean. Looking at the code doesn't say much really 

https://github.com/username_5/staticman/blob/018166e23b31d41f6ea2139db53e11bbd0c6ff56/lib/GitHub.js#L72

Repository name i gave staticman is definitely correct.

My repo is private as i'm trying to configure commenting system with staticman. Does it make any difference ? @username_5 

Does staticman works with private repos ? Anynone else had this error and worked it out ?
<issue_comment>username_2: Ok somehow i got this working, still not sure what was wrong though. Nothing changed whatsoever in my files. This error seems little erratical...
<issue_comment>username_3: I'm getting the same issue.
Now I'm also getting `MISSING_CONFIG_FIELDS` but they are in my staticman.yml file
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3, tell us your url's repo to check :+1:
<issue_comment>username_3: It turned out that I wasn't adding the right data endpoint. For example: `username_3/myrepo/articles`

I was leaving off the `articles` portion.
<issue_comment>username_4: Hello, same issue here.

This is the url I'm trying to hit: https://api.staticman.net/v2/entry/username_4/fiandes.io/master/comments

    fields[message] = demo

<issue_comment>username_5: @username_4 You're trying to use the `v2` endpoint, which requires a `staticman.yml` config file, and yet you're still using a `_config.yml` file for Staticman config. Check [here](https://github.com/username_5/staticman/blob/master/staticman.sample.yml) for a sample config file compatible with `v2` endpoints.

<issue_comment>username_5: @username_4 I don't see that file in your repo, though (https://github.com/username_4/fiandes.io), and so won't Staticman.
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_5 the file is in a branch that is not committed yet, I'm testing from my local machine. The `master` branch doesn't have comments enabled.
I'm looking at your code, and it would be great if you could log the actual error:

https://github.com/username_5/staticman/blob/018166e23b31d41f6ea2139db53e11bbd0c6ff56/lib/GitHub.js#L72

If I have time later, I'll send you a push request.
<issue_comment>username_5: If the file is in your local machine, Staticman won't be able to read it. It looks at your repo in whatever branch you tell it to (in your case, `master`).
<issue_comment>username_6: Same issue here, I already checked the staticman.yml file and all configurations of the Minimal Mistakes theme and the error persists. My repository is https://github.com/username_6/bira.xyz
<issue_comment>username_7: same problem, 
staticman.yml: https://hastebin.com/azicototav.bash
i have a comments folder in my _data folder in my project root
<issue_comment>username_8: I am using github pages in a docs folder. So staticman.yml is in the docs folder too.  Can I configure staticman on heroku to use the `docs` folder?

username_0: Goorgeous was a good first run at the basic use cases for Org mode but there are two major problems with trying to keep a go parser (similar to asciidoc and rst):

1. Org mode itself is a moving target, varying from major versions and adding new functionality which would mean constantly trying to stay up to date with it's features for power users.
2. Different users are different versions of Org mode (9 was recently released and it has many difference from 8), which means trying to make everyone happy for their org version.

This PR leverages emacs as a subprocess the same way rst and asciidoc are used with one exception:

- `org-mode` uses its ""frontmatter"" to make decisions about how to render content, so rather than reading the frontmatter out and leaving the ""content"", the entire file's contents are left intact and a peek function gets the frontmatter to be passed along to the org parser.

https://github.com/username_0/goorgeous/issues/32#issuecomment-286092742

# Advantages

- Now users can use the Emacs Org version they feel comfortable with and can know that what they experience in Emacs for org-html-as-html is going to be what they get in Hugo.

# Disadvantages

- A new dependency on Emacs is introduced, which means the CI environment (or whatever environment is used to render and publish)

## Solution

- Docker with Emacs v 25 and diff. major versions of org-mode.

Rollup of changes:

- use Emacs as the org interpreter
- move org headers parsing from username_0/goorgeous to spf13/hugo
- remove goorgeous as dependency altogether

cc'ing the following users who've opened issues in goorgeous to give any feedback or concerns they have. @strow @yssource @priyadarshan @jackbaty @kaushalmodi 

@strow's workflow is to have `*.org` files in his `content` directory which means Hugo will overwrite his handrolled files. In the case that users want to ignore using Emacs org mode in Hugo, do we want to add a config option to [ignore invocation as suggested here](https://github.com/username_0/goorgeous/issues/32#issuecomment-285964518)? My gut reaction is to [suggest the workflow I recommended here](https://github.com/username_0/goorgeous/issues/32#issuecomment-286031146), but if we want to have an option to ignore rendering org files, I'm happy to add that.  

# Todo

- Update docs to reflect that Emacs is a requirement where rst docs exists."
