```graphql

    }

And when you provide it an ID for a what's new posts, will return `body: null`. Here's an ID to test that out:

}
```

In order to remedy this, we have possible solutions:
🅰️ We update the service so that, if it determines that an ""article"" is a what's new post, it uses a _different_ JSON endpoint to get the content.
🅱️ We update the service so that it doesn't show what's new posts when searching for help to show the user (the links will still be present in the left sidebar).

username_0: Military Grade cryptography as a term is problematic as it lacks clear definition today.

Most modern cryptography is 'military grade' and use of cryptography by civilian and military alike is similar and commonplace.
What was once a hip marketing buzzword now looks dated and does not speak to the sheer magnitude of the computational power that secures Bitcoin.

I think bitcoin dot org removing this statement with a more abstract ""mathematics and energy"", with a quick note on why these two concepts protect Bitcoin would be a good move to deprecate this dated marketing phrase and give the reader a better understanding of the fundamental concepts protecting their money.
<issue_comment>username_1: Thanks for contributing!

1.  I agree that ""military-grade cryptography"" is a bit vague and could be replaced as suggested or even replaced simply with ""cryptography"" or ""strong cryptography""
2. ""Proof of Work"" should not be capitalized
3. I'm less enthusiastic about the other changes as this is an overview page and also it might not be obvious that the ""signatures"" refer to the ""mathematics"" in the first sentence.
<issue_comment>username_2: LGTM, ""military-grade cryptography"" is a bad term and the changes you made read much more clear.

If one other contributor agrees on merging this, it will get merged.
<issue_comment>username_3: Can you hyperlink ""proof of work"" to a definition - so the user can be prompted to read about it further?
Also the first time ""proof of work"" is mentioned it should be followed by (POW) or (PoW) - this distinguishes it as jargon for a methodology. 

Example:
```
proof of work ([PoW](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work))	

proof-of-work ([PoW](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work))

```

proof of work ([PoW](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work))	

proof-of-work ([PoW](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work))


A link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography_standards
may also be useful some where...

###  These are only suggestions on how the content may be improved.
### Otherwise the changes are satisfactory as is.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thank you for the suggestion Randy, I have updated with hyperlinks to PoW and ECDSA on the bitcoin wiki.
The bitcoin wiki:ECDSA article might not be complete enough, do yourself or others have another preferred link? (wp:ECDSA over bitcoin wiki:ECDSA?)
<issue_comment>username_2: Nice work on this. Merging it now."

<issue_comment>username_0: The intention is to tell probes they should do something NOW (where now can be a window of X time).

We can have have probes check in every X time and the backend tells them to $do-nothing or test something.

We should discuss if we want to implement silent push at all.
