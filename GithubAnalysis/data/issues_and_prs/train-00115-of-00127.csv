username_0: From what I've seen, the documentation just says that you can omit parentheses (at http://elixir-lang.org/crash-course.html#calling-functions).  In some cases of ambiguity a syntax error is thrown, whereas in others one of the possible interpretations is used.

So it'd be nice to have some guidance on the site regarding the types of cases which (a) lead to syntax errors, (b) are valid but possibly ambiguous, or (c) are unproblematic (`func func :a`).   Needless to say, in ambiguous cases it's better to use parentheses rather than lean on the parser's rules, but it'd help to have some good exposition highlighting those cases so that developers can be more aware of them.

Might perhaps also be a good place to present some of the points from https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/elixir-lang-talk/MvZq30BYMqs since it's roughly the same topic (ambiguity when omitting parentheses) and it'd be nice to have it on the language's site to reach a broader audience.

I'd be happy to tackle this once I've got a proper grasp of the grammar rules in `elixir_parser.yrl`... which could be a while.
P.S. @ericmj might remember a line he reviewed in a code snippet of mine that went `PowerSet.of Enum.into [1,2,3], HashSet.new`, his comment on which got me looking at this.
<issue_comment>username_1: The rules should be this: allowing a function call inside another function call without parenthesis is only allowed if the first call contains only on argument:

    foo bar 1, 2, 3 # foo(bar(1, 2, 3))

Not ok:

    foo 1, bar 2, 3 # ERROR: is 3 in foo or bar?

Data structures are a bit more strict as they lend more to confusion:

    [bar 1] # ok
    [bar 1, 2, 3] # error

I don't think the crash course is the place for this though. It is meant to be a crash course and not a complete reference. I wouldn't add it to the getting started guide too because I would say it would be counter productive to go into such details such early on.
<issue_comment>username_0: For one thing, `foo :a, bar :b` is valid (and unambiguous), but wouldn't be valid according to the rule as stated.

The rule also assumes that the number of arguments to the first function can be identified unambiguously to begin with, which isn't the case.  `foo bar a, b` could (unless I'm missing something) also be intuitively interpreted as `foo(bar(a), b)`, in which case `foo` would have 2 arguments.

`foo :a, 10 + bar 5, :c` valid whereas `foo :a, bar 5, :c` isn't.
<issue_comment>username_1: Right, all those cases are ambiguous, the difference is if we decided to raise or choose one side. If they were not ambiguous, we wouldn't have this discussion. :)

Btw, this may help:

```iex

""foo(:a, 10 + bar(5, :c))""

You can find additional information in a blog post on LinkedIn (German only).
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/corona-warn-app-software-update-f%25C3%25BCr-ios-harald-lindlar/

is quite old (July 2020) and probably would be better to remove it because the information, especially about version numbers, is out of date.
<issue_comment>username_1: The instructions

1. Open the app settings.
2. Choose 'Prioritized Background Activity'.
3. Activate the prioritized background activity and allow the suggested changes.

are not really complete, because the Android app no longer makes the change, instead it just offers ""Open Device Settings"". This is quite confusing. See comments in https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/1884#issuecomment-744363225 and https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/1606.

Perhaps this is a good opportunity to improve the instructions, at least in the FAQ, if it is not possible to improve the instructions in the app in the short term?

<issue_comment>username_0: Funnily on mine UK and US English are mixed up ... what shall we use, US spelling?
<issue_comment>username_1: Maybe that should be ""Sie sehen jetzt das ..."" ?

I checked on Samsung Galaxy Android 8 & 10 and on a Google Pixel 3a Android 11 emulator.

On Google Pixel 3a Android 11 the menu is labelled ""Akkuoptimierung"" (no hypen)
On Samsung Galaxy Android 8 and Pixel 3a Android 11 the dropdown list is ""Alle Apps"" 

The app is always listed as Corona-Warn (not as Corona-Warn-App).

You probably need to add a general remark that the details may be different for different smartphone Android versions, models and vendors.

I would suggest also adding a comment at the top of the detailed instructions to say:

""Um die priorisierte Hintergrundaktivität zu **aktivieren** muss die Akkuverbrauchoptimierung **de-aktiviert** werden.""
<issue_comment>username_1: In English:

Menu name
- Optimise battery usage (UK) / Optimize battery usage (UK)
- Battery optimisation (UK) / Battery optimization (US)

Drop-down menu name
- All apps
- All

The Android app itself always uses US spelling, not UK spelling. The Android system menus depend on what language the user has chosen. The CWA FAQs so far are not consistent and mix US and UK spelling together.

There doesn't seem to be a standard name for what is technically referred to as the ""action overflow menu"" in Android

I quite like the ""three dot icon"", which I think that most people would understand without explanation. It is also sometimes called the ""kebab"" menu.

username_0: During discussions at the ReactConf AU afterparty, I had the idea of how powerful it would be if we could get developers to pointedly bring up these increasingly specific questions during job interviews:

1. Does your organization contribute to open source?
2. Does your organization contribute at least $100/yr per in-house developer to open source?

## What if...

What if there was a place where developers could promise to bring up these issues during interviews. Maybe they could be placed on a list of people who have promised to do so.

There's a further commitment of promising to refuse to work at an organization that does NOT give $100 to each developer to water the open source crops. This is a more aggressive step for later, maybe.

Such a website could either just be a markdown file that you can add yourself to, but it would be awesome if it could be a website with a Github OAuth login so that people's avatars could be displayed next to their names on the list. If it had a database backend, everyone could have a page like `100dollarpledge.org/username_0` that looked like a document by each individual making the promise.

## Employer Side

There could also be an employer side of the website (not unlike BudgetForOpenSource, or maybe even connected to the same backend) where employers could promise that they are doing this. It could be a great thing to link to on first recruiter response: ""Is the company on this list?""

username_0: * Clarify rules regarding NC pins
   * Clarify when they may be omitted
   * Clarify that they must be hidden when included.

Inspiration: https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-library-utils/issues/285
<issue_comment>username_0: Fixed
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 ok to merge?
<issue_comment>username_0: In my opinion yes. But i might be biased here ;)
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 i think this is ready to go. Nobody complained about it for a month or so and this is more an update of the KLC to document how everything is done in the library already than a new rule.
<issue_comment>username_2: Maybe ""unless they are not connected **or** part of a stack or power symbols""

Sorry I didn't come back on this earlier.

Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_2: Also, it's been so long that we may want to update the date on the revision history.
Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_0: Since when would one use a construction like A or B or C instead of A, B or C?
<issue_comment>username_2: Please ignore. In my mind I had read it as:

""Symbol pins must not be hidden unless they are not connected, part of a stack **of** power symbols""

And by stack of power symbols I understood stack of power pins in a symbol, so I misread that too.
So I was missing an ""or"" in place ofthe comma.
Just ignore, sorry for the noise.

After the date update, I think this can be merged.

Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_1 it looks like the link checker keeps failing for the digikey links, but I can access those fine in my own browser. I wonder if there is anything to do about this. It is not 404, but 403.
<issue_comment>username_0: I did not touch these links. So i suggest to open a separate issue about it as nobody will find a discussion about them in here and the result of such an discussion should not impact this change anyways.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 yes I know. It seems like you accidently pushed 29c33d5 to your klc_nc_pins branch. I guess you don't want that merge commit here.
<issue_comment>username_0: I needed a merge commit as i had a conflict on the klc version page.
<issue_comment>username_2: `klc.adoc` needs to be updated too. Otherwise, I think it's all ready to go.
Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_2: Thanks, @username_0. Looks good to go.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3, @username_1 are there any open problems with this? Should the library team start to fully handle KLC parts of the website including merging?

I have seen, and then subsequently requested, to have test pins visible. Some ICs have test pins which don't have value for the end user in a normal application but are be used during IC testing or programming or other validation. Sometimes these pins are marked as ""NC"" so it seems to fit here. Are these pins to be visible? If so, can it be noted with these changes?

See my two comments above, fix the branch conflict, and update the KLC revision/date. Then I'd be happy to see this merged.

@username_3 @username_1 
Please see Rene's question above and respond. Thank you.
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_0 
Oh, and while it's related but not required, http://kicad-pcb.org/libraries/klc/S4.6/ doesn't mention that NC pins can be inside the symbol body. Yet we do that for non-rectangular symbols (opamps and comparators) or if the symbol outline is too small to fit all NC pins.

If you wanted to include that, since it's also about NC pins, nice. If not, that's OK too.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_4 i think the non response to our question can be seen as the go ahead for us to be responsible for merging website content for the KLC.

Regarding test pins: Depends on how they are marked in the datasheet. If the datasheet mentions them as do not connect (without further information) then it is to be handled as a NC pin as described here.
