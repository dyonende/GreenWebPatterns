username_0: Hi everyone,

first of all, I want to say how useful and great RSS Bridge is! I use it on a daily basis, and it's a powerful and easy to use tool.

When used against a Twitter profile, emojis are displayed in a really large size, which distracts a little bit while reading the tweet. Here is an example:

<img width=""499"" alt=""screenshot 2019-01-26 at 14 49 30"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/739940/51788067-ffed1e00-2179-11e9-9a3c-97ff621b49bc.png"">

I don't know if this also happens with other bridges.

The screenshot was done on Tiny Tiny RSS, but with News Explorer (on macOS) the issue is also there.

For reference or replication, here is the tweet in the screenshot: 
https://twitter.com/username_0/status/1088950943658446848. And I use my own RSS Bridge instance at https://feeder.aleryon.science.

Is it a bug in RSS Bridge, or something that is misconfigured in my instance?

Thank you!
<issue_comment>username_1: After digging the code, I just realized that this issue was already fixed two years ago. It is even done the way I suggested above.
it's just that Firefox appears to strip all style attributes from feed items when I inspect it there, that's why I thought this is missing. But it's present in the output source.

So, if these emojis are displayed larger, your feed reader probably strips style attributes, so this solution does not have any effect then.

username_0: I'm trying to add staticmanapp as a collaborator to my repository (https://github.com/username_0/blog), but whenever I've tried to go accept the invite by either https://api.staticman.net/v2/connect/username_0/blog or https://api.staticman.net/v2/connect/eeemil/blog (for trying case sensitivity) it just says ""Invitation not found"".

![screenshot](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7189109/44958472-02a45980-aee1-11e8-9868-19442856725d.png)
<issue_comment>username_1: I have also been facing this issue. If it helps, mine is a private repo.
<issue_comment>username_0: When I tried https://api.staticman.net/v2/connect/username_0/blog again ~18 hours later, it worked and I received an OK. For me, the issue is resolved but I'll wait for a developer to mark this as solved if this issue is affecting more people.

Perhaps there is a delay from inviting staticmanapp untill the invite can be accepted? If so, this should be documented on https://staticman.net/docs/
<issue_comment>username_1: I think this is an intermittent server load problem, since I am still getting the invitation not found error.
<issue_comment>username_2: I am facing the same problem
<issue_comment>username_1: Mine was also automatically resolved in a day or so. I guess there's a waiting list.
<issue_comment>username_3: I have the same problem. I sent the invitation 18 hours ago, and using the accept link, I've received the JSON message ""Too many requests in this time frame"", and a date for the next allowed request. I reloaded the page, and the ""Invitation not found"" message appeared.

Now, same steps happen: first a JSON message, ""Too many requests..."", and in second page load, ""Invitation not found""... Still I don't have the invitation accepted.
<issue_comment>username_2: Its been two days, and still `invitation pending` or `too many requests`. 

If @username_10 may check for the issue (he is the creator of staticman).
<issue_comment>username_4: Same here :)
<issue_comment>username_5: I have the same issue. It just returns ""Invitation not found"".
<issue_comment>username_6: I also get ""Invitation not found"". Looks like I have to wait.
<issue_comment>username_7: Me too... keep getting the same ""Invitation not found""...
<issue_comment>username_8: Same thing here also. Two test sites and the invitations are not found.
<issue_comment>username_9: Same here, did anyone got it sorted?
<issue_comment>username_10: Sorry, I’m AFK for a few days, but I’ll have a look when I get back on Sunday or Monday. The “Too many requests” is a message from the GitHub API indicating that we’re over the limit, I wonder if the “Invitation not found” is a similar thing, i.e. the user being added to too many repos.
<issue_comment>username_9: Thank you Eduardo, boas ferias ;)
<issue_comment>username_11: no response from me either...
<issue_comment>username_11: does anyone have any updates on this issue?
<issue_comment>username_3: I got `OK` two days ago. Perhaps this is an intermitent issue...
<issue_comment>username_8: I never got `OK`... More than a week of waiting...
<issue_comment>username_12: If this issue is urgent, why don't consider [setting up your own API instance](https://www.flyinggrizzly.net/2017/12/setting-up-staticman-server/)?  Provided you have a (free) Heroku account, [the whole setup](https://vincenttam.gitlab.io/post/2018-09-16-staticman-powered-gitlab-pages/2/) can be done under fifteen&nbsp;minutes.
<issue_comment>username_13: Indeed, this is also the described solution in https://github.com/username_10/staticman/issues/222.

However, it is not explicitely described anywhere yet, and reduces the appeal quite a bit. As far as I'm concerned, I would rather pay a small fee than deploy my own.
<issue_comment>username_12: As a consequence of [@username_10's request](https://github.com/username_10/staticman/pull/219#issuecomment-417657297), I've really built [one running on a free Heroku dyno](https://staticman3.herokuapp.com) to test the newly available #219 GitLab suuport.  The associated Git* bots are both named @staticmanlab.
<issue_comment>username_13: (Sorry, I wasn't talking about the deployment process, for which you've given an excellent and totally clear link, I was talking about the Staticman getting started: it doesn't mention these potential API limit problems yet.)
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_13 I see your point.  It's better to mention this limitation at the very beginning, so that users can choose between

1. use public API instance
2. setup own API instance

This is more efficient as @staticmanapp will receive less invitations.
<issue_comment>username_14: This still happened to me after waiting for five days. The response is still 'invitation not found'. Is there any workaround for this?

Thanks
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_14 As depicted on Staticman's set, Staticman functions basically like a :truck: truck which POSTs HTML :page_facing_up: form data into your GitHub/GitLab repo :file_folder: (running on any GitHub/GitLab server).

When a bus is not working, passengers would be asked to take another one.  Similarly, for a _workaround_, you can use [_my API instance_](https://staticman3.herokuapp.com) (built at the request of @username_10 for testing #219) or even [build your own instance](https://www.flyinggrizzly.net/2017/12/setting-up-staticman-server/) within Heroku's free tier.
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_14 To bypass this invitation problem, why not try GitLab Pages?  In GitLab, there's no such invitation mechanism---you just add the bot (say @staticmanlab) into the contributing members.
 
If you really love open source, migrating from the _proprietary_ GitHub to _open souce_ GitLab, which has _native_ CD/CI support, will free you from the aforementioned GitHub API limit.
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_2 I don't know about that, but a quick search points me to a GitLab forum question ""*
Does GitLab have an API rate limit*"".  The last comment lists out several endpoints which controls the traffic.  Hope that helps.

The last question is precisely the problem.  Now the :truck: is overloaded.  One may either wait (for an indefinite time period) for a larger truck, or build his/her own one.  Building the former costs surely a fortune, while building the later for a personal blog can be free.
<issue_comment>username_13: It would be nice to have a breakdown of the usage. Does somebody really believe that there's enough Staticman-powered websites for the bot to hit 5k requests an hour? I have a feeling that if anything, it is a spam problem that we have.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_12 Furthur exploring the link in the last comment that you mentioned, points thay GitLab indeed have api request limit
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17742733/46062276-e8c80080-c186-11e8-8633-e47fd728dca9.png)

Also mentioned [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38478806/does-gitlab-api-have-a-rate-limit)

**Which means it is a matter of time when enough people use someone's GitLab api and hit 600 req/min.**

Looks like self hosted instance for your personal use only is the safe option, **BUT** that too only upto the limit that the number of users commenting on your self hosted staticman api should not collectively generates more than 600 req/min.
<issue_comment>username_14: This is a matter of scalability indeed.

Maybe we'll end up building federated commenting (API) system where people can build their API servers (with their request limits) and join them with existing ones.

Also, if @username_2 picture says 600 req/min/IP that's actually good enough for normal people because one IP should have less than 600 requests per minute.
<issue_comment>username_2: but only if they have deployed their own personal api instance. If group of staticman users ends up using the same api, the limit will be easily achieved.

As mentioned by @username_12 [here ](https://github.com/username_10/staticman/issues/227#issuecomment-424495509) about the steps of deployment, it is still not easy for majority of people.
<issue_comment>username_13: Wait, what? Let's say 50 people use the same deployment. 600 req/min / 50 sites = 12 requests per minute per site. That means at the end of the week, each site would have received a maximum of 12\*60\*24\*7 = 120k comments.

The same math applied to GitHub means 50 sites each get a maximum of 16k comments per week.

On my most visited website (800-1000 daily visits), I get maximum 10 comments a week. I have Staticman running on 3 sites so in the end even that 'high figure' gets drowned into a very low average of 3. Am I missing something or is some spammer abusing the tool?
<issue_comment>username_2: 👍 Thanks for the math part. Honestly I didn't calculate the numbers when commenting.

Even 12 request per minute per site can be a bottleneck at the peak time of the site visit (only for some very interesting article/site). (Please note I don't have any research fact)

With the growing popularity of staticman, there can be more than 50 people using some specific api instance (this is what happening now with @staticmanapp on github). 

I am sure with the use of reCaptcha with staticman, spamming is negligible.
<issue_comment>username_13: 50 was just an example to show we have an extremely large comments per minute / site ratio at our disposal. Yet people have been consistently unable to add Staticman as a collaborator for a month. In my opinion, either we have too many unmaintained sites that weren't set up with captchas and get spam, or somebody is deliberately bricking the instance.
<issue_comment>username_2: If someone deliberately bricking it, the best way is -- hitting the api from different IPs concurrently to reach the limit per minute using `https://api.staticman.net/v2/entry/{GITHUB USERNAME}/{GITHUB REPOSITORY}}`

In any-case we need data/log (if available) of @staticmanapp to find out the cause.
<issue_comment>username_13: Excellent catch, @username_12. I vote for adding a captcha or an Akismet key to that site.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_12  Allow me to correct, by commits if you mean pull requests. Since there are only 30 commits out of which only few are caused by staticman comment entry.

However, there are > 3000 pull requests caused by staticman, but spanned over last two months. There are only 13 pull requests in the lat 24 hours. 

I am sure this is not the cause for eating away of API quota.
<issue_comment>username_13: I just spammed said form a little and noticed that while I still can't add Staticman to my repository, my comments got through just fine. What the hell is going on? If we're hitting the API limit, we would hit it for all cases.
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_2 @username_13 Thannks for doing the math.  In fact, since the public (production and development and my own) API instances are powered by Heroku apps, they are subject to *both* Heroku and GitHub/GitLab's limits.  From it's server response time to a GET request to `/`, the first instance _isn't_ run on the free dyno, whereas the other two _are_. 

From a server-side point of view, the traffic from GET requests to `/` and `/favicon.ico` and POST requests with status 500 (possibly due to GitHub/GitLab repo owners who wish to test/use Staticman) are also considerable.

Since the documentation for Staticman v3 in #219 has not yet been integrated to the official site, it's possible that a user *has forgotten to supply the Git service provider* when firing a POST request to the `/entry` endpoint, like

    POST /entry/v3/user/repo/branch/property (wrong URL!)

he/she may keep trying until he/she hits status 427 ""too many requests"" or he/she gets tired of status 500 ""internal server error"".

For the case of the public production instance (still running v2), it has to handle requests with _wrong_ endpoint path/request body from GitHub repo owners, who might fire (a multitude of invalid POST) requests over a short period of time.

Lacking knowledge in networking, while testing Staticman with [a sample GitHub repo](https://git.io/fxf18), I've tried sending POST requests from the famous RESTclient, but all of them _failed_ with a status 500.  Finally, I've given up those request clients and coded a HTML form.  As a result, the project has been expanded to a [minimal Jekyll+Staticman v3 GitHub Pages](https://git.io/smdemo).
![staticman-ok](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5748535/46254851-fe466e80-c495-11e8-94f3-e515bd79aa31.png)
Looking back, if I had kept trying RESTclient, I might have hit the bottleneck of my own API instance _without_ building anything.
<issue_comment>username_15: I'm also having the same issue when contacting the API - I'm getting ""Invitation not found"" although I submitted one a couple of hours earlier. So there's no solution yet except to host your own API?
<issue_comment>username_15: @username_12 Thanks for the advice! Since switching to GitLab wasn't an option for me, I instantiated my own version of the Staticman API. It was actually quite easy thanks to your great description in your [blog post](https://vincenttam.gitlab.io/post/2018-09-16-staticman-powered-gitlab-pages/2/). 

To share my experience, I just wrote a [blog post about getting the Staticman API running and getting the commenting system working for Hugo](https://www.datascienceblog.net/post/other/staticman_comments/).
<issue_comment>username_16: Perhaps we'll go the self-hosted route, having same issues here and unresolved after a week.
<issue_comment>username_17: Thanks this will be helpful
<issue_comment>username_18: At first attempt, haven't dug in deeper, getting an RSA error Key not Found error thrown after npm start.
<issue_comment>username_18: @username_12 altered a bit, using netlify.toml instead of Procfile as wanting to run on Netlify instead. But yeah I checked that article out.
<issue_comment>username_13: @username_18 wait, can you keep an NPM process alive from a Netlify build? With the free plan? I thought this was meant to build static sites only.
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_15 When I read your old reply the second time, I find your reason for setting up a custom API instance (""switching to GitLab wasn't an option"") *misleading*.  In fact, the *same* API instancebcan handle multiple Git service providers.  Again, please refer to my demos.

1. Minimal Jekyll GitHub Pages at https://git.io/smdemo
2. Minimal Hugo GitLab pages at https://vincenttam.gitlab.io/test-hugo-staticman

For the correct URL schemes, please refer to #219.
<issue_comment>username_19: I having the same issue. I am either getting ""Invitation not found"" or ""too many requests"".

<issue_comment>username_12: @username_19 In your repo username_19/Blog/docs/_docs/18-history.md, it's written that custom Staticman API path is allowed, thanks to @username_13, who has contributed to mmistakes/minimal-mistakes#1842.

From #239, it seems that @staticmanapp is taking a holiday for the moment.  #222 suggests building one's own API instance, whereas #219, which resolves #22, allows us to *bypass this problem by switching to GitLab*.  (You may click on the link above to my sample Staticman demo on GitLab.)

P.S. Searching [#staticman](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=%23staticman&s=stars&type=Repositories) on GitHub, I've found that okfde/edulabs#555 is generated by @staticwalrus.  Maybe you can find a temporary workaround from this.  I prefer switching to the *free* GitLab though.
<issue_comment>username_19: How do I make my own staticman instance.
<issue_comment>username_20: Hey everyone,
It has started to worry me that I may have some misconfguration somewhere. After about three days, I am still getting the 'Invitation not found'.

I have studied the code in 'connect.js' file to understand how the API end point responses to the connect requests. It seems like that it looksup my GitHub username and repository and if it can't find it, throws the error I mentioned above.

There is a process/method in that file called 'getRepoInvites'. It's trying to match 'invitation.repository.full_name' with the one been requested.

Can anyone shed more light on this or help me understand this more?

Thanks,
Saeed
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_20 https://github.com/username_10/staticman/issues/243#issuecomment-450472431 provides a detailed analysis for this problem.

IMHO, the simplest workaround is to migrate to GitLab, which allows collaboration *without* invited users approval.  Import of a GitHub project can be done in one click.  It has *integrated* CD/CI, which greatly simplified setup for Hugo blogs.  (On GitHub, you need a third-party CD/CI service for Hugo sites.)  The online platform can also generate a GitLab CI config file from a drop-down menu.
<issue_comment>username_20: Thanks, but migrating to GitLab isn't a solution for me to be honest. My site is running on Jekyll, and Jekylls works perfectly with GitHub, including GitHub Pages.

The comment you have shared the link to is very helpful. I think I would be able to run my own Staticman instance, and swing away from all these API limitations. I will write an update here, which I think might help others too.
<issue_comment>username_21: Hey @username_12, 
I think I misunderstood your comment above. Correct me if I'm wrong, you were advising me to setup my own instance of Staticman API on GitLab. Yes? Then I can use that as a bot to collaborate with my current GitHub account where my blog is hosted. This way I can run Staticman API under my own GitLab account without invitation etc. Please advise.
<issue_comment>username_12: I'm _not_ sure whether a GitLab bot can interact with a GitHub repo.  Even though it's possible, it would be far more sensible to include a personal access token for each Git server provider in Staticman's API config.  For example, the public API instance for GitLab holds _two_ tokens, one for @staticmanlab on GitHub and one for [Staticman Lab](https://gitlab.com/staticmanlab) on GitLab.
<issue_comment>username_20: Hey @username_12,

Thanks for your response. @username_20sStaticmanAPI also belongs to me. I have created a new GitHub accound, forked the staticman master branch into it, and cloned a copy from it on my local machine. For experimental purposes and learn how I can decentralise Staticman.

Excellent, I have taken a quick look at some of the features that GitLab provides, and they also have hosting solution similar to GitHub called GitLab Pages. This will help me to setup my site hassle free, as I am currently using GitHub Pages.

Will start this project from tomorrow morning. Will leave comments here if I need yours or anybody else's help.
<issue_comment>username_1: I probably shouldn't get into this, but my understanding was that GitLab is also proprietary, but it also has an open sourced version which may be self hosted. Could we maybe highlight the most important points of this discussion and have this one closed? I fear a lot of the later topics are getting in the way of understanding the workarounds. (this includes people saying me too and stuff)
<issue_comment>username_12: Since the problem is ongoing, I _don't_ think closing this issue is appropriate.

The workarounds are ways to help people to enjoy this great service despite Staticman's API limit.  Since the documentation has not described them, it's natural that users ask questions about them.  Instead of closing this issue and hiding them in the closed tab, we should let them stay there until the problem is resolved.

More importantly, the decentralization of Staticman's API allows netizens to enjoy this service in countries where some Google and Facebook are forbidden.

Hence, through the discussion of the workarounds, some users enjoy greater freedom when using Staticman.  This phenomenon should be embraced instead of feared.
<issue_comment>username_22: i have the same issue... and after 1 month not worked
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_22 You may find this repo useful: https://github.com/asadise/blog

P.S. It's made by an Iranian 🇮🇷 web developer.
<issue_comment>username_20: Hey @username_12, I would like to self host my own API instance (#2 above). For that I would need your help please.

My goal is (as per your advise above) to host my own Staticman API instance. And I want to do it through GitLab, and to be hosted on GitLab Page (**Not Heroku**). Then I can use it through my GitLab Repo (My blog, which has been migrated from GitHub, and is hosted on GitLab Page)

In stage 1 of your tutorial, I need a clone of Staticman from GitHub. Should I push this to a GitLab account created as a Staticman bot? Then it can be hosted on GitLab Page, correct?

Please advise.
<issue_comment>username_12: GitLab Pages is static web host, not a Node.js web host.
<issue_comment>username_2: The above reason was given in the tutorial, but few days ago **Microsoft gave the access to create private repositories** to free users as well. (It was not when the tutorial was written). and I want to stick with GitHub (personal preference)

Is there any tutorial (verified to be working) for creating private instance of **staticman-v3** with GitHub?
<issue_comment>username_12: A Staticman API instance can interact with one GitHub **and**/or GitLab account.  This is documented in the official documentation for the API config and Staticman v3's API endpoint scheme in #219.  (`GITHUB_TOKEN` and `GITLAB_TOKEN`).
<issue_comment>username_12: I omitted the word ""private"" in my last reply.

Setting up an API instance (server-side) and setting up a remote Git repo (client-side) are two *separate* processes.

If you want a tutorial on ""private instance of Staticman"", I recommend @gabeluci's _updated_ article in #244: https://www.gabescode.com/staticman/2019/01/03/create-staticman-instance.html
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_12 Thanks
I found your tutorial (https://vincenttam.gitlab.io/post/2018-09-16-staticman-powered-gitlab-pages/2/)
informative. 
I am using minimal mistakes theme and staticman official github public instance served me well for a month before felling down for this issue. I may give one last (also my first attempt) shot to set up private instance, that's why looking for very specific and reliable tutorial.

Your tutorial looks promising, however I wanted  to use  the free service of Heroku, which has a limitation of making service sleep after 30 minutes of inactivity. How you manged to deal with this?
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_2 Perhaps a ping to the API server when a JavaScript input event is triggered.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_12 Any idea about time delay for API server to get active, if tried to ping just before posting comment? I meant to say do we need to wait some time after pinging so the comment may not get unregistered.
Also did you have verified this ping method?
<issue_comment>username_12: No, I've not tested that, but that should work in principle.  A free dyno needs 20s to wake up, so I think it's better to ping the API when the user has input sth.
<issue_comment>username_10: Hi. Can I ask anyone with problems authenticating with Staticman to please read [this comment](https://github.com/username_10/staticman/issues/243#issuecomment-453754860) and try the suggested route? It's only active on the development instance, I'm looking to collect feedback before deploying to production.

Thanks for your patience.
<issue_comment>username_23: I'm getting the error when trying to accept the invitation.

```
Application error
An error occurred in the application and your page could not be served. If you are the application owner, check your logs for details. You can do this from the Heroku CLI with the command
heroku logs --tail
```

I m using NEXT with NETLIFY CMS
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_25 Please stay away from public instances and set up your own one.
<issue_comment>username_25: Hi Vincent ,

I am newbie to all this , do u mean i should take the pull repo of staticman and add to my code than use it
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_25 Sorry for late reply.  If you are satisfied with the features in the standard release, you can simply click the Heroku deploy button and config the necessary variables through the online dashboard."
