username_0: A list of sites running Staticman appears in the last section of README.  Almost _all_ of them include a link to their source code, including @username_1 's personal blog.

However, the ([Source](https://gitlab.com/username_1/username_1.gitlab.io/)) link at the right of the entry
- [username_1.me](https://username_1.me)

points to its GitLab project page, which **doesn't** show the source code generating the site.

Proposal:
1. ~([Source](https://gitlab.com/username_1/username_1.gitlab.io/))~; or
2. @username_1 publishes the source code and fixes the link.

<issue_comment>username_1: this list is great thanks for sharing
<issue_comment>username_2: I can take this issue on, starting working on this locally.
<issue_comment>username_1: Awesome! Thanks Ariana
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 @username_0 Just remembered to mention that I went ahead and added the Bay Area Resources to the current pull request that has been pushed along with the updated logo sizing. 
Pull Request: #184
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 @username_1 Are we good to go on closing this issue?<issue_closed>

I'm a plugin/theme author and I appreciate your excellent work on static blogging. 

But I find that both usage and API doc hosted on https://hexo.io are very unclear. Due to the dynamic-typed nature of Javascript, I can find little useful information on listed API function signature without being fully documented: I have no idea what argument I should pass, what type this variable is, what property this argument has, what I should return in callback. 

Also the examples provided by doc are trivial and not very helpful. I have to dig into source code or program with the power of `console.log`, to get it work.

As for the error output, once I did something wrong I can only get an exception with little useful message thrown from a deeeeeeeeeep `Promise` async call stack.
