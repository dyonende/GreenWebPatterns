I'm sorry that some people are frustrated with the project, I can relate to that. But please remember that the code is fully open-source, which means anyone can simply run their own instance, with their own GitHub account, and bypass all these limitations. The issue we're seeing here is really a problem with the free, public instance I decided to host for everyone. In hindsight, this probably wasn't the best of ideas, because it puts pressure on me to be the sole gatekeeper of this service.\r\n\r\nI've not abandoned the project and I'm thinking of solutions to solve both problems: the problem that a single GitHub account acting on behalf of everyone isn't maintainable, and the problem that in the current scheme of things, where the public instance that I run is the centrepiece of the project, I represent a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nFor example, I'm keen on the idea of rebuilding Staticman as a [Netlify function](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/), so that effectively everyone is running their own instance (for free) rather than relying on a centralised service (which I'm covering the costs for). In this scenario, people would provide access to their own GitHub account, which commits would be made from, thus removing the issue of quota limits.\r\n\r\nAll I can say is that your patience is much appreciated and I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on how we can make this more manageable for everyone."", 'title': None, 'type': 'comment'}

username_0: @username_3 you know your software - would this be possible?
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 
I am in process of creating an app that does exactly that. It is still in development and is in a private repository. I can extend invitation if you want to look or contribute. 

I expect it to be completed by end of this month.
<issue_comment>username_0: Good to hear @username_1!
Let me know when it's ready, I can help with testing :slightly_smiling_face:
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 Sure. I will let you know.
<issue_comment>username_2: Just a friendly wake-up call to @username_3. Staticman is awesome, but right now, it's hitting its limit and people are developing alternatives. Please find the time to develop a solution so we can continue using this fantastic app without this very anoying limitation.
<issue_comment>username_3: Hi everyone. I'm sorry that some people are frustrated with the project, I can relate to that. But please remember that the code is fully open-source, which means anyone can simply run their own instance, with their own GitHub account, and bypass all these limitations. The issue we're seeing here is really a problem with the free, public instance I decided to host for everyone. In hindsight, this probably wasn't the best of ideas, because it puts pressure on me to be the sole gatekeeper of this service.

I've not abandoned the project and I'm thinking of solutions to solve both problems: the problem that a single GitHub account acting on behalf of everyone isn't maintainable, and the problem that in the current scheme of things, where the public instance that I run is the centrepiece of the project, I represent a bottleneck.

For example, I'm keen on the idea of rebuilding Staticman as a [Netlify function](https://www.netlify.com/docs/functions/), so that effectively everyone is running their own instance (for free) rather than relying on a centralised service (which I'm covering the costs for). In this scenario, people would provide access to their own GitHub account, which commits would be made from, thus removing the issue of quota limits.

All I can say is that your patience is much appreciated and I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on how we can make this more manageable for everyone.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_3 The best solution in my opinion, would simply be a GitHub app.
GitHub Apps also have their call limits, but they have this per installation. 

If repo A & repo B, install an app on their repos, each gets 5k hits per hour. 
I have already started working on this, I will present it here when it is prsentable.

Till then, I am also open to any discussion that how we can make it work for everybody.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks for the updates @username_3 ! :raised_hands: 

A Netlify function would be great as a simpler solution to people wanting to self-host their instance.

However one of the things I love with Staticman is how simple it is to set it up only using a Github repo!

I think that many people would benefit from such a ""centralized"" service, be it for testing or to allow comments on small websites and blogs (GH pages for example), where setting up Netlify+AWS Lamba to run a self-hosted instance seems like a lot of trouble.

In this case a Github app would probably be the best solution! @username_1 can you consider making your working repo public so that we can take a look and maybe contribute? :slightly_smiling_face:
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 Please give me a day or two. 

I want to finish a few tasks by myself. 
I don't want myself to be an embarrasment as this is my first project. 
I just need it to be presentable with a few features. Then, i will work on it with everyone.
<issue_comment>username_3: No reason to feel embarrassed at all! We all appreciate the effort you're putting in. Whenever you feel comfortable showing your code, I'm happy to review and help you change anything that needs tweaking.
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_1 if you need any help I'd be happy to assist as well.
<issue_comment>username_2: Thanks for your reply @username_3. Staticman running in a netlify function sounds like a very good idea. I'm looking forward to you testing this out and, if found feasible, giving us feedback on how to set it up for ourselves. Keep up the good work :D
<issue_comment>username_3: Hi all.

I had a go at implementing Staticman as a GitHub App, which should fix many of the issues people are seeing at the moment. Can I ask for some volunteers to help me test it? Here's how:

1. Remove `staticmanapp` as a collaborator
1. Go to https://github.com/apps/staticman-net and install the application on your repository
1. Submit a comment as usual, but use `https://dev.staticman.net` instead of `https://api.staticman.net` as the base URL.

Any help is much appreciated.
<issue_comment>username_5: Hi @username_3 

Great to hear the news from you!

Not sure if i've just done something wrong but i'm getting `500` errors.  I removed `staticmanapp` as a collaborator.  I installed the staticman-net github app with access to my repo.  And, i tried submitting a comment to https://dev.staticman.net/v2/entry/username_5/my_blog/master/comments.  After retrying a couple times i tried curl'ing the `/v2/connect/username_5/my_blog` endpoint and also got a `500` response.  

Note that i'm using Hugo with the engimo them which has staticman support built in, but i've never successfully used staticman before (as my invitation was ""not found"").  Also I'm testing using Hugo on my localhost - assume the post-id stuff wouldn't cause the problem, but i mention in case i'm wrong.  The request that's failing is (as copied from chrome debugger, removing user agent and cookies: 

```
curl -i  'https://dev.staticman.net/v2/entry/username_5/my_blog/master/comments' -H 'authority: dev.staticman.net' -H 'cache-control: max-age=0' -H 'origin: http://localhost:1313' -H 'upgrade-insecure-requests: 1' -H 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8' -H 'accept-encoding: gzip, deflate, br' -H 'accept-language: en-US,en;q=0.9' --data 'options%5BpostId%5D=dc33308b4aef09b40e86a6783d501abd&options%5Bredirect%5D=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A1313%2Fposts%2Fmore_on_tech_debt%2F%23submission-success&options%5BredirectError%5D=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A1313%2Fposts%2Fmore_on_tech_debt%2F%23submission-failure&fields%5Bhoneypot%5D=&fields%5Bpermalink%5D=%2Fposts%2Fmore_on_tech_debt%2F&fields%5Bparent_id%5D=&fields%5Bcontent%5D=test+comment&fields%5Bauthor%5D=rich&fields%5Bemail%5D=username_5%40gmail.com&fields%5Bsite%5D=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com' --compressed
```
<issue_comment>username_3: Thanks for the feedback. I’ll try to debug it tonight using your sample request and will come back with my findings. 

Thank you all for your patience.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_5 Your site doesn't seem to be configured properly. I don't see a configuration file for Staticman on https://github.com/username_5/my_blog.
<issue_comment>username_5: Ah!  My bad!  Had only configured locally and never pushed to GH as my invite had not been accepted.  And, did this testing having forgotten all about that!  

Sorry - I should have checked and figured this out myself.

I've fixed that now, however, and still getting `500` response.  I don't want you having to go about debugging my config if you think that's likely the issue.  I'll try looking at the code to understand better what it's doing.  But, one quick thing to confirm:  if i configure `  path: ""data/comments/{options.postId}""
` inside `staticman.yml` should i need that directory/path to already exist?
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_5 Your config is fine, it was an issue with an environment variable on the development instance. I've fixed it, tested again and it seems to be working.

You can see a submission here: https://github.com/username_5/my_blog/commit/e36206d3ffe075d1fedeb2845af0cb94bf5ae04f
<issue_comment>username_5: @username_3 Thanks so much for this project, moving it to a github app, and for your help here!
<issue_comment>username_6: Thanks @username_3. This seems to working great for me on my project. https://github.com/username_6/GDPRDPIAT
<issue_comment>username_3: I've updated the comment above to point to the new `v3` endpoint. The idea is that people will carry on using `v1` or `v2` endpoints if they're using the legacy `staticmanapp` authentication method, whilst people that have installed the new GitHub App will use the `v3` endpoints.
<issue_comment>username_7: Staticman app v3 works great at https://spinningnumbers.org/a/staticman.html <https://spinningnumbers.org/a/staticman.html> 

thanks so much for this valuable service.

<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3 this is amazing!! :tada: 

Works perfectly on my end, THANK YOU for everything! :smiley:
<issue_comment>username_8: Looks like this is working great for me.  I am having a few issues with Mailgun, but I think that is on my side.  Everything else looks good (reCaptcha, posts, etc.).
<issue_comment>username_7: My site is on github-pages. I'm using the App with the v3 endpoint, per Eduardo's edited instructions. When I submit a comment it is accepted and shows up in _data/comments. However, github-pages/Jekyll does not trigger a rebuild of the parent article. I waited the suggested 10 minutes for github-pages to react. If I make a trivial change to an unrelated article and push, the rebuild is triggered promptly and the comment appears.
https://spinningnumbers.org/a/staticman.html, https://github.com/username_7/username_7.github.io
<issue_comment>username_9: Hello. I'm attempting to use this GitHub application for a project I'm associated with and I'm running into some issues. 

When using v3 of the API listed above, I'm receiving an _INVALID_VERSION_ error. I've removed _staticmanapp_ as a collaborator. I don't have admin access to the repo, so I'm checking with someone to ensure the application is pointing to that repo correctly. If this information is valid however, is there any other reason why one would receive a versioning error?
<issue_comment>username_10: I've authenticated the staticman app but I'm getting a too may requests error. Below is the cURL of hte request being sent by my form, any idea if i've got this set up incorrectly?

<issue_comment>username_8: @username_10

Use dev.staticman.net as the API endpoint if you are using the app. It looks like you are still using api.staticman.net.
<issue_comment>username_3: The new functionality is still on the development instance (dev.staticman.net). I’ll release it to the main API sometime this week, now that it seems to work well for everyone.
<issue_comment>username_9: I've noticed others are using curl express the error they are receiving, so here is a request from my repo: `curl -d """" -X POST https://dev.staticman.net/v3/entry/github/duellinksmeta/duellinksmeta/master

<issue_comment>username_10: @username_3 @username_0 thanks for the quick reply, that was definitely an error on my part but now I'm getting the same ""Invalid Version"" error that @username_9 is getting
<issue_comment>username_11: My POST url above is suffixed with /comments
My understanding was that this is then used by staticman.yml to allow different configs, e.g. to /posts
If I post to the 'raw' URL https://dev.staticman.net/v3/entry/github/hortigraph/hortigraph.github.io/master
I also get an error response
```
{
    ""success"": false,
    ""errorCode"": ""INVALID_VERSION""
}
```
<issue_comment>username_8: It is my understanding, and how I I have always used the API, that you have your username, then repo, then branch, and finally the directory where you want your comments placed. I have never used it with the raw branch.

In my brief testing it looks like the directory is required after the branch in the API URL.
<issue_comment>username_8: @username_11 

Yes, I misspoke in my comment above. My apologies.  The property field refers to the block in your config file. 

When I perform a POST to your API endpoint I get the following:

```
iPad:~# curl -d """" -X POST https://dev.staticman.net/v3/entry/github/hortigraph/hortigraph.github.io/master/comments
{""success"":false,""errorCode"":""MISSING_PARAMS"",""data"":[""fields""]}
```

This is “good” as it means it is looking for the required fields as defined in you config file.
<issue_comment>username_10: I'm also getting MISSING_CONFIG_BLOCK now, and it seems to only happen if I have a validly formatted .yml file as staticman.yml in my directory (I had a junk file in there where I improperly re-downloaded the sample file and it threw a different error).

I'm trying to narrow down if the issues lie with the yml file itself or something with my call.

<issue_comment>username_11: @username_8 thanks again: I noticed other folks with recent errors are mainly posting to an endpoint without a field.

Yes, I think the app is accessing the repo somehow. 
It's when I post with fields I get the error. If I post with required fields missing, or fields that aren't specified in the accepted values, I don't get any specific error messages though, just success:false
<issue_comment>username_9: With the following comment between @username_8 and @username_11, I was able to get the instance working. 

As Dan mentioned, going from v2 to v3, the _property_  parameter within the API is no longer optional (at least seems that way). This was discovered through cloud's comment. After adding that to my API and adjusting the _staticman.yml_ file with this property, I was able to successfully submit a POST and received the expected file within the correct place (i.e. the _path_ variable with in the YAML file). 

Thanks again 👍
<issue_comment>username_8: @username_10 

The `path` field is missing from your config file.  See my functional config file [here](
https://github.com/username_8/dcwtest/blob/master/staticman.yml)
<issue_comment>username_11: @username_9 I'm very happy for you 👍 

Now to work out what my problem is, cos I think the config is correct, I'm posting to a url + FIELD with a matching config block, and it looks like it's not a problem with the API as others are working.

This is Jekyll on GH pages, which requires a _config.yml, which is where staticman V1 picked up it's config: maybe some confusion there...dunno.

Oh for a meaningful error message @username_3 please ???

Looking forward to that moment of clarity....
<issue_comment>username_8: @username_11 

I agree, your config file does look good.  I am looking around to see if anything else jumps out at me.
<issue_comment>username_10: @username_8 Awesome, it's working now. For anyone else still struggling, I'll post what I have.

I took Dan's config file and just modified the filenames and other relevant fields, and then used the following HTML for the comment form (relies on materialize css, is currently ugly but functional). I'm using jekyll, so I have this in an _includes file called statcman.html and then in my post layout I just include it at the bottom:

`<div class=""container light-blue lighten-5"">

<issue_comment>username_11: @username_9 Thanks for the moral support.
Agree, there's some problem parsing the yaml.
I've checked, removed and re-added theapp, and added to my personal repos in case it was anything to do with the repo being under an organisation. In any event, I appear to be talking to the app, so it's there I think, just having problems, which pretty much must be to do with the yaml, I just can't figure it out!
<issue_comment>username_11: @username_8 @username_9 and all.
I am at peace.

In the chain of things this MUST boil down to the content of my staticman.yml (unless the test after reinstalling the app didn't reflect that change)
I replaced with the standard sample: https://github.com/username_3/staticman/edit/master/staticman.sample.yml 
changing only the sitename.

So, thanks for this great advancement @username_3 : 3 more confirmed happy customers for v3 within the last hour. Perhaps some clarification on docs & improved error messages needed?

My issues are all user support, so no follow up required thanks, but I will report this back to mmistakes/minimal-mistakes#2034 as referncved earlier which may need changes to the bundled staticman.yml

Thanks again 👍
<issue_comment>username_9: @username_11 

I wanted to test a theory similar to yours and I saw different results. I decided to create a repository from scratch, take the sample YAML file from Staticman, not edit it and use curl against it. My results proved successful.

`curl -d ""fields[email]=foobar@gmail.com"" -X POST https://dev.staticman.net/v3/entry/github/username_9/staticman-test/master/comments
{""success"":false,""data"":[""name"",""message""],""rawError"":{""_smErrorCode"":""MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS"",""data"":[""name"",""message""]},""errorCode"":""MISSING_REQUIRED_FIELDS""}`
In above response, I only gave the parameters an email and received the message I spoke about earlier with the missing parameters.

`curl -d ""fields[email]=foobar@gmail.com&fields[name]=John Doe&fields[message]=A message to you"" -X POST https://dev.staticman.net/v3/entry/github/username_9/staticman-test/master/comments
{""success"":true,""fields"":{""email"":""726f7c3769f32d3da4656ea906d02adb"",""name"":""John Doe"",""message"":""A message to you"",""date"":1547936943}}`
In this response, I gave it the required parameters and received successful response. 

The only step left would be actually implement a form within my repository (https://github.com/username_9/staticman-test) and use it against the staticman bot itself. The fact that I'm not able to reproduce at least this much with your repository seems odd, but I wouldn't know where else to tell you begin searching at this point. 🤔
<issue_comment>username_12: I can confirm that V3 works well for me.
<issue_comment>username_13: I just got it working on my website. Thanks all of you for being so awesome and wholesome!
<issue_comment>username_14: I use a botpot field that is intended for a user to leave blank. However, these blank fields are appearing in the comment files added by Staticman. Is it possible to strip empty fields from the comment files?

Maybe a feature request to strip blank fields that are not in allowedFields would be more appropriate.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_14 @username_7 maybe you should post [new issues](https://github.com/username_3/staticman/issues/new) for this!

Your problem will have much more visibility than as a message on a thread with 50+ comments, and it'll let us keep issues organized :slightly_smiling_face: 

Closing this for now, feel free to reopen if relevant :wave:<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_15: Testing the v3 api I only get this error:
curl -d ""fields[name]=dom&fields[email]=truc@truc.net&fields[message]=test"" -X POST https://dev.staticman.net/v3/entry/github/username_15/onlefay-comm/master/comments
{""success"":false}
Does my github repository need to be public for the app to be able to push comments ?
<issue_comment>username_16: I started to add Staticman to my project today and ran into troubles with V2, presumably because of the rate limiting. Decided to give V3 a go and it just worked great first time 👍 

Might be worth considering updating the docs on the website because V2 was pretty much unusable for me.
<issue_comment>username_0: Agreed @username_16, I'm sure @username_3 would be open to a PR :slightly_smiling_face:
<issue_comment>username_17: I followed the instructions except that I do not understand step 3. I typed in the URL and got ""Cannot GET /v3/entry/github/username_17/light-transmuter/master"". Where am I supposed to go to submit the comment?
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_17 this URL is the one that your comment form has to POST to. The [Get started](https://staticman.net/docs/) doc is a good place to start building with Staticman :slightly_smiling_face:
<issue_comment>username_17: Thanks, I get it now. I made some other mistake apparently though, because now I'm getting this when I try to submit a comment.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4284600/54496277-17f83880-48b3-11e9-8437-621054f1d3b2.png)


I'll have to study the config options for a while.
<issue_comment>username_18: I don't have reCAPTCHA set but keep getting this error:

```
<issue_comment>username_19: I think the v3 Staticman app may be broken, but I'm not certain. See #294 for more details.
<issue_comment>username_18: Thanks for this update. I'm sure the app just scaled past what his service
could handle. I'll probably look for another solution (like Netlify).
<issue_comment>username_20: @username_18 That's a duplicate of #223.
<issue_comment>username_20: In the reCATPCHA section of your Staticman config, even if `enabled: false`, if you *didn't* comment out the unused `siteKey` and `secret`, that can contribute to an error.  Here, you've passed the value `null` to these two attributes.

To avoid that you may either comment out the whole line (e.g. https://github.com/username_20/BJPubTest1)

```yml
  # reCaptcha
  # Register your domain at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ and choose reCAPTCHA V2
  reCaptcha:
    enabled: false
    #siteKey: ""6LdRBykTAAAAAFB46MnIu6ixuxwu9W1ihFF8G60Q""
    # Encrypt reCaptcha secret key using Staticman /encrypt endpoint
    # For more information, https://staticman.net/docs/encryption
    #secret: ""PznnZGu3P6eTHRPLORniSq+J61YEf+A9zmColXDM5icqF49gbunH51B8+h+i2IvewpuxtA9TFoK68TuhUp/X3YKmmqhXasegHYabY50fqF9nJh9npWNhvITdkQHeaOqnFXUIwxfiEeUt49Yoa2waRR7a5LdRAP3SVM8hz0KIBT4=""
```

or use an empty string `""""` instead of `null`. (e.g. [Hugo Future Imperfect Slim](https://github.com/username_18/hugo-future-imperfect-slim/blob/master/exampleSite/staticman.yml#L61-L65))

```yml
  # reCaptcha
  # Register your domain at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/ and choose reCAPTCHA V2
  reCaptcha:
    enabled: false
    #siteKey: """"
    # Encrypt reCaptcha secret key using Staticman /encrypt endpoint
    # For more information, https://staticman.net/docs/encryption
    #secret: """"
```

<!-- Thanks for filing an issue! Before submitting, please fill in the following information. -->
<!-- See https://kubernetes.io/docs/contribute/start/ for guidance on writing an actionable issue description. -->

<!--Required Information-->
kubectl PowerShell example does not work in Windows. `cat` is an alias for Get-Content, which by default parses a file line-by-line.

**Proposed Solution:**
Change PowerShell example to use the -Raw flag in Get-Content cmdlet (and change `cat` to `Get-Content` to avoid alias ambiguity).

```
kubectl patch deployment patch-demo --patch $(Get-Content patch-file.yaml -Raw)
```

username_0: ## Feature Request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Maybe?

* You cannot vertically or horizontally center a container item.
* You cannot re-order container items based on breakpoint.
* You cannot define per-breakpoint container values (background, foreground, etc.).
* You cannot set a minimum height for a container or item
* You cannot use VH in editor.html without an infinite scroll bug.
* Items cannot vertically stretch to match siblings.
* You cannot set a universal gutter (or gap) between items

**Describe the solution you'd like**

The Dx (also known as Dexter) team wants to contribute our Flex Container component.

It is mostly based on flexbox with other niceties thrown in:

### Component per-breakpoint features (individually configurable per mobile, tablet, desktop)
* Set item (child) order
* Set justify-content
* Set align-items
* Set align-content
* Set background image
* Set background color
* Set foreground color
* Set gap (to simulate the CSS grid gap feature)
* Set min height (px or vh)

### Flex item per-breakpoint features (configurable per mobile, tablet, desktop)
* Set width (auto, column 1-12, %, px)
* Set min height (px or vh)

### One size fits all features
* Container CTA - Ability to make the entire container clickable (with notice of accessibility concerns)
* Enable Container - Similar to Bootstrap's container: contstrain max widths using a 'container' CSS class.
* Accessibility Attributes - Ability to set element, landmark name, and landmark label.

### Overall features that come with (i.e. required) and useful for other components
* dxPolicy - An inheritance scheme for content policy properties that will pick up component-level props first if present. API similarity to ValueMap.
* Component Governance Render Condition - The ability to completely remove dialog property selection if a boolean is set at the policy level to turn the property off. If policy property is set, page-level author cannot change property. ACLs allow for admins and template authors to still view and edit dialog properties.
* Context-Aware Datasource - A datasource to power granite selects & colorfields that allows tennant / brand / locale specific properties.
* Author VH - The ability to set CSS vertical height without editor.html infinitely scrolling.
* Author Watch - The ability to execute javascript after component edit without using MutationObserver in both author and publish.
* OSGi breakpoint service - The ability to configure breakpoint pixel values to satisfy per-breakpoint configs above.

**Are there alternatives?**
CSS Grid, but it's not IE11 compatible (without transpiling / decent authorability)

**Documentation**
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

As I find time, I'll put some videos together in an AEM context. Most of the docs are probably covered with the above criteria.

<issue_comment>username_1: I'm okay with changing `-march=nocona` to `-march=k8`, and rebuilding a few packages, but rebuilding all is a big ask.
<issue_comment>username_0: This seems fine. We can start with the set that were selected for aarch/ppc64le and then add others as people need them.
<issue_comment>username_2: Do you have statistics and benchmarks you can point to for a costs/benefits analysis here?
<issue_comment>username_0: I am not sure what exactly you are looking for @username_2, but I don't have anything offhand. 

I am an academic and keep running into very old machines that lack more recent instructions like SSE3. It is hard to say how many people have had this problem, but I have seen it twice. 

Per the discussion above, the idea would be to have a very small channel with generic x86-64 builds for these cases.

I don't feel very strongly here, so happy to be punt or be convinced otherwise! :)
<issue_comment>username_2: It might be nice to process our binaries to figure out when they need rebuilding for this channel. Many won't touch SSE3 for example and rebuilding those would be a bit of a waste.
<issue_comment>username_0: For sure! The other way to do this would be to use virtual packages and have conda build embed the required instructions directly in the package requirements. I am guessing you have thoughts on that.
<issue_comment>username_2: I wish I had time for thoughts! Sounds nice though. I've not looked at virtual packages yet.
<issue_comment>username_3: This would be nice to have to swich on as needed
<issue_comment>username_0: Ok. I’m game to work on this after the openmp stuff goes through. So the simplest path is a migrator with some custom compilers. I’m more inclined to go after the virtual package since it solves bigger problems. TBH we probably need both since if some package won’t install due to having say sse3, we will want to build a version without.
<issue_comment>username_1: I don't think we need a custom compiler or a custom channel. Packages that really care about sse3 have runtime detection of the cpu like openblas, gmp, etc.
<issue_comment>username_0: Ok. I’m not going to push it. I’ve seen illegal instruction errors on two different machines now. It could be people using march=native too.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_0: Closing for now.
<issue_comment>username_1: What I meant was that I'm fine with changing `nocona` to `k8`.
<issue_comment>username_0: I’d be in favor of building out a generic x86-64 chanel/label which uses none of nocona optimizations.

<issue_comment>username_0: Ahhhh. Yeah we could go that route.
<issue_comment>username_0: Bumping @username_4 @username_2 since I think they were involved when defaults set its `march` flags. What do y'all think if conda-forge goes with `k8` instead of `nocona`?
<issue_comment>username_4: `k8` would be fine.  From what I recall `nocona` was selected as `k8` was not documented in the GCC manual at the time. It looks to be documented now.  

The only CPU that I am aware of that `nocona` will causes issue with but `k8` should be alright with are the [first generation 130 nm SledgeHammer Opteron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opteron#Opteron_(130_nm_SOI)) processors which lack SSE3.  I'm surprised at how long these seem to remain in service.  

I have a suspicion that some of the illegal instruction errors are a result of virtualization rather than limitation of the actual hardware.
<issue_comment>username_0: Good call on virtualization! 

It appears that the [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_AMD_Opteron_microprocessors#Opteron_6100-series_%22Magny-Cours%22_(45_nm)) I had trouble with should have this instruction, but it is not listed in `/proc/cpuinfo`

<!--
  What happens if you skip this step?

  Someone will read your bug report, and maybe will be able to help you,
  but it’s unlikely that it will get much attention from the team. Eventually,
  the issue will likely get closed in favor of issues that have reproducible demos.

  Please remember that:

    * Issues without reproducible demos have a very low priority.
    * The person fixing the bug would have to do that anyway. Please be respectful of their time.
    * You might figure out the issues yourself as you work on extracting it.

<issue_comment>username_1: Thanks, let's reopen.

I don't have windows to test the repro, unfortunately, but people have reported that using other shells (like PowerShell) could solve problem. Can you try some other Windows shell if possible?
<issue_comment>username_0: What I use is PowerShell 7, and I also tried PowerShell 5.1, CMD and nu shell. Unfortunately, the same error...

`npm run start` cannot work, too.

It seems like parsing engine treat `./assets/测试.pdf` as `./assets\测试.pdf` in Windows and the backslash is used as an escape character.
