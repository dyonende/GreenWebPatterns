username_0: Please add license in GitHub settings of the repository.

Currently, GitHub could not identify Your project licence, and it's not shown in interface, and not available via API also.

Ref : https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/
<issue_comment>username_1: There is no such setting.

We have a `LICENSE.md` file. Not sure why it's not recognized by GH.
<issue_comment>username_0: Hi !

I just get the answer from GitHub support team. Basically, GitHub uses automatic license detector : https://github.com/benbalter/licensee

I just installed it locally and get following results for gohugoio/hugo

```

username_0: The first parameter seems to work.

Changing the quotes to:
`-ScriptArgs`: `powershell -File build.ps1 -ScriptArgs ""-someflag -my_setting=\""from a batch file\""""` fixes that issue.

An alternative that seems to work would be:
`-ScriptArgs`: `powershell -File build.ps1 -ScriptArgs '-someflag','-my_setting=""from a batch file""'` (no space between the arguments!)

Took me some time to figure this out so I think it would be worth mentioning that somewhere.
<issue_comment>username_0: I actually spent some more time with it and I have very very strange results.
Running:
```
powershell.exe -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File build.ps1 -Target ""Run-UI-Tests"" -Configuration ""Release"" -ScriptArgs ""--coverage=true"",""--uiTestWhere=\""class == UITests.Aut01\""""
```
will use the following expression with `Invoke-Expression`:
```
& ""C:\Development\ELCA\ksta-verana\tools\Cake\Cake.exe"" ""build.cake"" -target=""Run-UI-Tests"" -configuration=""Release"" -verbosity=""Verbose""    --coverage=true,--uiTestWhere=""class == UITests.Aut01""
```
and that works correctly.

Now when I use:
```
""C:\Development\ELCA\ksta-verana\tools\Cake\Cake.exe"" ""build.cake"" -target=""Run-UI-Tests"" -configuration=""Release"" -verbosity=""Verbose""    --coverage=true,--uiTestWhere=""class == UITests.Aut01""
```
from a command prompt I get the exception:
```
Error: true,--uiTestWhere=""class == UITests.Aut01"" is not a valid value for Boolean.
```
(coverage is a boolean parameter in the cake file).
That is already strange enough.
Additionally when I run the PowerShell script mentioned on top from a Jenkins slave, it also does not work.

It does work in all cases if I use:
```
powershell.exe -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File build.ps1 -Target ""Run-UI-Tests"" -Configuration ""Release"" -ScriptArgs ""--coverage=true --uiTestWhere=\""class == UITests.Aut01\""""

username_0: As we have been moving all distribution-specific docs out of ""Getting Started"" with PRs like #2576, #2577, #2569, #2492, we should now clean up the first place people look when trying to install Kubeflow.

As proposed by @username_2 we should clearly indicate the two ""paths"" for installing Kubeflow:
1. __Roll your own__ -- using the `kubeflow/manifests` yourself, with no support
2. __Supported Distribution__ -- using a vendor or community supported install process

I think this leaves us with the following sections in ""Getting Started"" / ""Installing Kubeflow"":

```md
## Overview
* discussion about Kubeflow being a ""Kubernetes"" app, with multiple components which can be mix-and-matched
* discussion about the two ""paths"" as described above, ""Roll your own"" and ""Distribution""
* discussion about how Kubeflow is versioned, e.g. what 1.3, 1.4, even mean.

## Path 1: Roll Your Own
* Either take the content in the README of `kubeflow/manifests`, or just link to it
* https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests#kubeflow-manifests

## Path 2: Supported Distribution 

### Vendor Supported
a TABLE which lists the currently maintained VENDOR-SUPPORTED distributions, and links to their docs

CONTENT (Alphabetical):
* `Kubeflow on AWS`
* `Kubeflow on Azure`
* `Kubeflow on GCP`
* `Kubeflow on IBM Cloud`
* `Kubeflow on Openshift` (Combine: ""Kubeflow Operator"" and ""Kubeflow on Openshift"" page)
* `Kubeflow on MicroK8s` (Rename from ""MicroK8s Kubeflow add-on"" page)
* `Kubeflow with Charmed Operators` (Rename from ""Kubeflow Charmed Operators"" page)
* `Kubeflow with MiniKF`

### Community Supported
a TABLE which lists the currently maintained COMMUNITY-SUPPORTED distributions, and links to their docs

CONTENT (Alphabetical):
* `Kubeflow with ArgoCD` (New page)
* `Kubeflow with kfctl` (Rename from ""kfctl"" page)

## Next Steps
* links to important component docs ""Pipelines"", ""Notebooks"", etc.
```
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 there are quite a lot of renames here, but I think it will make the user experience easier.

I have used `Kubeflow on XXX` for cases were the ""distribution"" is a guide for using Kubeflow on a platform, and `Kubeflow with XXX` when the ""distribution"" is a tool for deploying/using kubeflow arbitrarily.
<issue_comment>username_1: I would draw the distinction between `platform-specific distributions` and `multi-platform distributions`. I think this is what you have tried to achieve with the `on XXX` VS `with XXX` but IMO it is too subtle, might be confusing. 

We could split into two tables: 
```
Platform-specific distributions (Alphabetical):
* `Kubeflow on AWS`
* `Kubeflow on Azure`
* `Kubeflow on GCP`
* `Kubeflow on IBM Cloud`
* `Kubeflow on Openshift` 
* `Kubeflow on MicroK8s` 

Multi-platform distributions (Alphabetical):
* `Kubeflow with Charmed Operators` 
* `Kubeflow with MiniKF`
```

The rest LGTM!
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 I agree with all your comments above.

I would rename `Kubeflow with MiniKF` to `Kubeflow with Arrikto MiniKF` to denote explicitly who is the vendor supporting the distro, so it is easy for new users. You may want to do the same for Charmed Operators (e.g., Canonical Charmed Operators). For the Platform-specific distros it is evident, so no need to do anything there.

Also, it may make sense for all the tables to go to the distributions page and leave here only a link to the distributions page, same as we do for Path 1, so the user doesn't have to scroll a lot, but I'll let you decide on this.

Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_1: Looking at my previous proposal + @username_2 comments one option would be:
```
Platform-specific distributions (Alphabetical):
* `Kubeflow on AWS`
* `Kubeflow on Azure`
* `Kubeflow on GCP`
* `Kubeflow on IBM Cloud`
* `Kubeflow on Openshift` 

Multi-platform distributions (Alphabetical):
* `Arrikto MiniKF`
* `MicroK8s Kubeflow add-on`
* `Kubeflow Charmed Operators`
```
@username_2 maybe `Arrikto MiniKF` is shorter and better than `Kubeflow with Arrikto MiniKF`, WDYT? 

**// note 1:** I moved MicroK8s from platform-specific to multi-platform, because being a small K8s, it can be run on multiple platforms.
**// note 2:** I think that with the separation of `platform-specific` and `multi-platform` distributions we don't need `Kubeflow with` to create this separation.

**// Issue 1:** I would like to have a way to show users on e.g. `AWS` that they can also use one of the `multi-platform distributions` on AWS, not necessarily the AWS-specific distribution. Any ideas?

@username_0 WDYT?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 I agree with all your comments and notes.

Wrt to the issue, I agree as well. The only two ways I can think of are:

1. Add a parenthesis next to the multi-platform items, which will include all the currently supported platforms, e.g.,:
  * `Arrikto MiniKF` (AWS, GCP, laptop/desktop)
  * `MicroK8s Kubeflow add-on (..., ..., ...)
  ...
2. Change ""Multi-platform distributions"" to ""Platform-agnostic distributions across clouds""

I'm not sure I can think of something to add on the first section, but maybe someone has an idea for this as well.

<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 note that we need to remove the kfctl entry from this page:

* `Kubeflow with kfctl` (Rename from ""kfctl"" page)

Take a look at https://github.com/kubeflow/website/pull/2604, which @castrojo just provided after today's update on https://github.com/kubeflow/manifests/issues/1798 from vendors, where both Cisco and Arrikto dropped support for kfctl, and thus all corresponding docs become obsolete and out-of-date for 1.3.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 
* I agree with splitting on single/multi platform
* I think MiniKF is a Platform-specific one, as its a single VM image on vagrant
* Re letting AWS/GCP users know there are other options, we will just say under ""Multi-platform distributions"" that these distributions support any existing + compliant K8S cluster

__I think we should call the two paths:__
* Path 1: Roll Your Own
   * ""A warning that this is an advanced option, which is not officially supported by the project""
   * ""A quick description of what this means, with a link to the `kubeflow/manifests` readme""
* Path 2: Use a Distribution
   * Platform-specific distributions
      * ""A description that these could be anything from a managed service to a fully contained VM image""
   * Multi-platform distributions
      * ""A description that these should support any existing & complaint K8S cluster""

---

I was thinking something like this for the distribution tables.

__Platform-specific distributions:__

Name | Maintained By
-- | --
[Kubeflow on AWS](...) | [AWS](...)
Kubeflow on Azure | Azure
Kubeflow on GCP | GCP
Kubeflow on IBM Cloud | IBM Cloud
Kubeflow on Openshift | Red Hat
Kubeflow on MicroK8S | Canonical
Kubeflow on MiniKF | Arrikto

__Multi-platform distributions:__

Name | Maintained By
-- | --
ArgoFlow | ArgoFlow Team
Charmed Operators | Canonical
Kfctl Command Line | N/A

__NOTE:__
* ""Name"" would be link to the distribution's docs
* ""Maintained By"" would link to the company/community support page

---

I am happy to have a crack at a PR it unless you really want to.
<issue_comment>username_2: This doesn't hold. The Manifests WG maintain and guarantee that these instructions should work, so it is definitely supported.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2

Re MiniKF: I think its probably better to remove the distinction, and add a column to clarify, for example:

Name | Maintained By | Deployment Target
-- | -- | --
Kubeflow on AWS | AWS | EKS Clusters
Kubeflow on Azure | Azure | AKS Clusters
Kubeflow on GCP | GCP | GKE Clusters
Kubeflow on IBM Cloud | IBM Cloud | IKS Clusters
Kubeflow on Openshift | Red Hat | Openshift Clusters
Kubeflow on MicroK8S | Canonical | MicroK8S Clusters
MiniKF | Arrikto | AWS Marketplace, GCP Marketplace, Local VirtualBox
ArgoFlow | ArgoFlow Community | K8S Clusters with Argo-CD Installed
Charmed Operators | Canonical | K8S Clusters with Juju Installed

Re the warning: What I am trying to say is that users should not expect any environment-specific support from the Kubeflow Community for the ""roll your own"" path
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 and @username_2 I have raised a WIP PR for this refactor https://github.com/kubeflow/website/pull/2611

I will finish up the text-copy some time other than midnight my time!
<issue_comment>username_1: Thank you @username_2 and @username_0 for the comments on this front and for creating the WIP PR! 

A few comments on your proposing table @username_0: 

1. **No separation, only 1 table:** I think that `deployment target` or `target platforms` make things clear for users.
2. **A proper map:** I think we should not forget that this page is a gateway and that it should be clear to users where to click on that table. I think we should strict links to the `Name` column and rename that to `Documentation` - links in every column as in your [PR](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/pull/2611) will be hard to follow and drive users off the website.

I have `MicroK8s` and `Charmed Operators` specific suggestions, but I will add these to your PR. :) 

(PS: @username_2 I deleted one comment from you because it was repeated)
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 OK, this makes sense then, but I think this is pretty clear by the ""on your own"" part of the title of the section.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 For ArgoFlow I think the target should be `Any K8S Clusters` (or something similar), as the Argo CD installation is part of the deployment, and Argo CD does not technically need to run on the same cluster as Kubeflow. Otherwise user might think they need to figure out how to deploy Argo CD on their own before going through the documentation.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 (and @username_3) I love the energy behind ArgoFlow, but I feel a bit wary of adding it directly here as per your [proposal](https://github.com/kubeflow/website/issues/2590#issuecomment-819246265). 

According to #2611, the way you propose this table is to link the ArgoFlow documentation to its own [repo](https://github.com/argoflow/argoflow). I am not sure what is the right way to proceed here. If creating appropriate docs in Kubeflow for this distribution and point from here.

I would overall want to make sure that the goal of this page as a gateway and map to Kubeflow docs is met.

I would suggest tackling this specific issue on a separate thread, making structure independent from content. WDYT?
<issue_comment>username_2: I agree with @username_1. All links in this page should redirect to Kubeflow docs, not external sites.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 @username_2  specifically regarding comment that we should only link to kubeflow.org...

I actually think we should do the opposite (over time) just as kubernetes.io doesn't host EKS docs, we shouldn't host vendor specific docs, but rather link to parter websites.

This will do a few things:
1. Make it easier for distributions to update thier docs
2. Prevents it looking like the community endorses any specific distribution
2. Encourage vendors to keep thier docs updated (as it's gonna look bad for vendors if they neglect docs on their own website)

NOTE: This is not about the structure of the table, I agree with comments about improving how the links are displayed, and will update the PR
<issue_comment>username_4: and some ideas for further improvement:
* the link to manifest README should better pin to 1.3.0 release once we pin the final release
* I think we should add a column ""Issue Tracker"" where people can report distribution specific issues.
<issue_comment>username_4: the immediate problems are fixed by https://github.com/kubeflow/website/pull/2635

Where do you plan to create a new issue tracking future improvements? Or shall we keep the discussion here?<issue_closed>"
