Jonah has a point - we do have a responsibility to the SCF as an entity

a joint statement, not as affiliates of Software Carpentry, but as
individuals refusing to be belittled, cowed, or shut down by a bully. Risk
is our new reality; while it isn't right to ask the SCF to wear that risk,
each of us can choose for themselves, and let subtext do the talking.

Guide for migrating from a self-hosted Kong Gateway setup to Konnect Cloud. 
* Convert object configurations with decK
* Add dev portal documents with decK
* Decide what to do with your data planes, then power down old ones + their datastores, if those exist
* Do all the other things manually using a bunch of other guides

Used decK to test as much as possible; the rest is manual and hard to write concrete steps for. The whole process is mostly ""use deck to convert your configuration, then add everything else manually, therefore follow these other guides"".

Guide based on personal testing, demos, and Michael Heap's blog: https://konghq.com/blog/migrating-kong-gateway-konnect/. 

### Reason
Need a migration guide between self-hosted and cloud deployments.

<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 What is the current approach that you've been using? 
Right now, what comes to mind is either:
* Export config with the workspace flag and combine into one file, then convert to Konnect format. Make sure that all object names are unique; may require lots of work to convert
* Maybe convert files individually? Is this better or worse?

The closest parallel I can think of in Konnect to workspaces is service packages - if your services are small permutations of each other, then maybe we can recommend grouping them as versions? What would make sense here?
<issue_comment>username_1: IMO the main driver behind separating services by workspace is RBAC. I don't think combining services into service packages will suffice with the current set of features, but Product might have another opinion.
<issue_comment>username_0: That sounds like a good argument for your original suggestion to push these changes and look for answers about workspaces after, which is what'll I'll do. Tracking it with: https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-1889"

username_0: Initially I was very excited by hugo's simple configuration and large variety of themes. I was hopeful that switching between themes would be as simple as modifying the theme name in the config and rebuilding.

However, it has become clear that most themes use different parameter fields to represent the same concept. Some themes use `tagline`, others use `description` or `title`. Some themes use top level params for github username, facebook username, etc, some use a nested `params.social` category for setting these. Some themes pay attention to `menu`, some don't. Some themes require manually copying images into static/ and `avatarurl` ... the list goes on.

The end result is that themes are not compatible with one another in the way one may grow used to with systems such as Ghost or Wordpress.
<issue_comment>username_1: I think this is a very good point. There have been prior discussions here about vetting themes. There is a guideline for theme development, but I don't think it covers such things as common patterns. Also, because Hugo is ~0.5 there has been quite a bit of change over the last couple of years, so a theme created some time ago might not be using patterns present now.
<issue_comment>username_0: I suspect having some patterns documented, even a nice skel dir that theme developers could start from, would be helpful. Maybe themes that follow those patterns to the T could be given a special tag in the theme directory for extra visibility.

cars = hugo

Same same.

i understand that this is a hard problem to solve. i also believe there are ways to improve usability while remaining flexible.

the simplest solution to this problem is theme dev documentation. provide a list of best practices, config parameters which are used by many themes for a particular purpose.

another, more complex, solution is to show theme features in the theme index by their use of well-known config params. this would provide an incentive but not limit flexibility.

to put my money where my mouth is, i've done some early exploration.

start with a local checkout of hugoThemes:

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/gohugoio/hugoThemes

$ cd hugoThemes
```

count distinct parameters across all themes, ignoring duplicates within a single theme:

```
$ egrep -or '\.Param ""[^""]+""' . | sed -r 's/^[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)\/[^\:]+/\1/g' | sort | uniq -u | wc -l
253
```

count of parameters used only once in any theme (note, this under represents the problem, as this would exclude parameters which are used twice in the same theme):

```
$ egrep -or '\.Param ""[^""]+""' . | sed -r 's/^[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)\/[^\:]+/\1/g' | sort | uniq -u | cut -d: -f2- | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort | uniq -u | wc -l
155
```

**key finding**: approx 40% of all parameters are only used in only one theme.

top 30 most commonly used params and the number of themes they are used in:

```
$ egrep -or '\.Param ""[^""]+""' . | sed -r 's/^[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)\/[^\:]+/\1/g' | sort -u | cut -d: -f2- | awk '{ print $2 }' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn -k 1 | head -n 30

username_0: ## Motivation

https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/3152

Some users are assembling Docusaurus sites from docs coming from multiple places, and the url to edit the doc in the upstream doc referential is not necessarily an url that docusaurus is able to compute based on the files it sees on the filesystem.

Also, we need the ability to customize the editUrl per locale. This allows to link to a specific translation system (like Crowdin) for a subset of locales for example, or having one git repo per locale and using git submodules for assembling the final localized site etc...

A functional form of editUrl gives full power to the user

### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?

yes

## Test Plan
