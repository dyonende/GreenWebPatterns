Enable 2019 merch fundraiser (#588)

This PR embeds code onto the donation page to allow individual giving
for merchandise. It's powered by Shopify.

Changes include:

- Added fundraiser.html shortcode which contains all of the
markup/embeds for the fundraiser.  - Added _fundraiser.scss for a few
additional styles, included in main.scss - Included the shortcode on
all languages donate.html page. It's in English, was told that would
be OK.

By default, the fundraiser is hidden by a style in _fundraiser.scss,
you can change that when you want to enable the fundraiser.

Following last year's fundraiser, you'll need to update the CSP to
include Shopify's url used in the embed (https://sdks.shopifycdn.com).

Update 93-double-pendulum.md

Written a few weeks ago and fits very nicely to the coding challenge. Especially it answers the question from your video why the order of speed and position integration matters (I'll also add a comment to the youtube video or somewhere else on this) --> it changes the integration mode from explicit euler (large integration error, accumulates energy) to symplectic euler (way better accuracy)...

I've created this animation before the CodingTrain Video came out based on 3Blue1Brown's video so its neither OOP nor can it deal with more than 4 digits (at least not my pc :D).

rm RFMVasconcelos (#2981)

Dear community,

In the last 2 years, I have had the great pleasure to be part of the community building this amazing open-source tool. I am quite satisfied in feeling that I left a small dent in the overall experience for new users.

Today I see my path take a different course, which I am excited to invest my full energy into. 🚀

I was also very lucky to work on Canonical's distribution - which I leave in the great hands of @knkski  @DomFleischmann and more. 

If you want to stay in touch, please connect via LinkedIn.

I nominate @knkski to take on some of the responsibilities I held, in his own capacity, given his 3 years of dedication to Kubeflow.

With Gratitude,
Rui

cmd/locktrigger: add fix for Cloud Build race

When a project uses “continuous deployment powered by Cloud Build”,
the deployment is a little bit too continuous: when multiple commits
land in a short time window, Cloud Build will run all the triggered
build jobs in parallel. If each job does “gcloud app deploy”, there
is no guarantee which will win: perhaps an older commit will complete
last, resulting in the newest commit not actually being the final
deployed version of the site. This should probably be fixed in
“continuous deployment powered by Cloud Build”, but until then,
locktrigger works around the problem.

Use locktrigger in cmd/golangorg/cloudbuild.yaml to ensure that
when multiple commits race, the newest one always runs its
go-app-deploy.sh last.

Update build-configuration.md

This change demostrates how you can include a multi-line PowerShell script *inside* an event (in order that other Powershell / CMD lines could be used before / after it).  I noticed that the extra line breaks appeared to be required in my own usage and so have documented it as such.  

For what it's worth I've had problems using the multi-line PowerShell script covering an entire event that is already documented.  As a result I simply don't use that method now that I know there is this alternate approach.

Initial application: Attempt to clarify instructions on contractor questions

The form is still a mess. The verbose name and help text mention "hours
spent contacting" not "hours per week". The form promises that you'll be
able to provide actual hours on the next part of the form. That's not
true, I think? There's no additional form after this, unless it's the
volunteer time commitments section.

So the models still need work for this section. TODO:
 - add a description field so people can say what kind of contracting or
   consulting they do
 - remove unhelpful field help text that contradicts the instructions I
   just wrote

I could expand the form processing loop and over-write the verbose name
and help text. But I'm running out of energy and time. It's good enough,
sorry applicants...

Fix grammar typo in Design Principles docs (#9324)

features → feature
> There is nothing "bad" about using state or lifecycle hooks in components. Like any powerful feature**s**, they should be used in moderation, but we have no intention to remove them.

I can’t explain the exact grammatical principle this violates, but it sounds wrong to my native English ears that “feature” is plural here. Another way to check if the grammar sounds right is to change the order of the clauses: ”They should be used in moderation, like any powerful feature“ sounds right, whereas “They should be used in moderation, like any powerful features” does not.

add coreutils to docker-support/Dockerfile

* tail --lines=+2 in hack/import-flux2-assets.sh

does not work with busybox tail

* Run "make docker-push-support"
  to rebuild from docker-support/ and push a new image to the repo

(This change will require the maintainer to run this command,
to update the fluxcd/website docker support container images.)

* refactor docker build

It should be a bit easier for the maintainer to push a change to the
docker-support image (you should basically never need to rebuild hugo,
which unfortunately takes 5-10 minutes even on a fast machine.)

This is not a big deal but if someone finds a problem with the docker
support image and they can't actually test and contribute a simple fix
like adding the coreutils package without spending 10 mins needlessly
building the same version of hugo we already are using, that's not a
very good contrib-experience.

* add support for remote builder

Especially when on a slow or remote network, or if your workstation is
underpowered, it can be extremely useful to invoke a remote builder.

I wanted to use a remote builder because I'm on a slow network. I don't
expect most people to use this, but it's there, (I used it, it worked!)

* make docker-push-support

Put regular docker things back (don't use okteto build or okteto push)
