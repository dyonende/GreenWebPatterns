username_0: ## 🐛 Bug Report

### Prerequisites

- [X] I'm using the latest version of Docusaurus.
- [X] I have tried the `npm run clear` or `yarn clear` command.
- [X] I have tried `rm -rf node_modules yarn.lock package-lock.json` and re-installing packages.
- [X] I have tried creating a repro with https://new.docusaurus.io
- [X] I have read the console error message carefully (if applicable)

### Description

The `img` tag in the NavbarLogo attribute in docusaurus.config.js file to add Logo to Navbar doesn't have any option/prop to set the `height` and `width` of the logo. Because of this, the Lighthouse Report fails and suggests to add `width` and `height` to the logo image.

### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on issues](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-new-issues)?

Yes, I have Read it.

## Steps to reproduce

1. Run Lighthouse test on any docusaurus powered website
1. See the diagnostics message that suggests to add `width` and `height` attribute
1. Also in `inspect` element, width and height attributes are missing.

## Expected behavior

There should be props for this in order to add height and width to image along with defaults.

## Screen Shot

## Your environment
- Docusaurus version used: latest
- Environment name and version (e.g. Chrome 78.0.3904.108, Node.js 10.17.0): Chrome 87
- Operating system and version (e.g. Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS): Windows 10

I am new to the community and willing to contribute towards this issue. Please let me know more insights upon this. Would like to take this up!
<issue_comment>username_1: As a further request: can we make all images within a Markdown file have the `height` (and `width`, maybe) attribute as well? Is it possible to fetch this data when we convert them to `require` calls?

This ensures that there's no layout shift as the images load.<issue_closed>"

a) client-side compiling, per AJAX transaction
b) server-side compiling, per AJAX transaction
c) mass server-side compiling to JSON objects at initial load, in some monstrous file

None of these options seemed very efficient, manageable or scalable in the long-term. this solution also allows my to minify all my HTML in production getting even more speed and easily move the code to other platforms in HTML for different non-Jade/Node projects.

Is it for the community? because the community asks specific questions, ""when we will have this or that"", ""when we plan to work on this issue"", ""when we will enable this"". For me roadmap is ""you know where you go, and these are the steps"". From vision, we clearly know where we are going and I love it. Just for me step = action, you take this step and then another, `User is able to focus only on business logic` is definitely not a step, especially after you explained it, you see that even I didn\'t get it and immediately thought it is just about model generation and that this one soon will be solved. For me, this is like an item on a more granular vision.\r\n\r\nI hope you know what I mean, I\'m basically doing a community guardian job here. ""Product"" must have vision and roadmap, but users need a list of action points, a pipeline of stuff, ordered, like ""this is for 2020"" (just few items) and ""this is for later"" (with clear annotation saying ""this is super dynamic, you want to push something faster, join us""). \r\n\r\nI just think that most people, when they ask for the roadmap, they ask for a list of things they want to do or can be affected by. \r\n\r\nTake for example HTML template and react component. If I would be outside the core team, I would be super interested to know in advance on what we plan to do there and when, so I can plan my stuff. `Deprecate html-template and improve asyncapi-react` is an item I would expect, one line that can clearly tell me if this is important for me or not.\r\n\r\nYes, I know roadmap != backlog, but they should be aligned (and best if combined in one view.\r\n\r\nNow, when I look at 👇🏼 \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2021-03-05 at 13 18 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6995927/110114627-4085df80-7db5-11eb-8b1d-a64628c951d1.png)\r\n\r\nThe black ones are the details people expect, backlog items that will be handled.

username_0: ### Description

This adds a new page containing the description of the 5-year vision, goals, and roadmap.

- [ ] Add paragraphs explaining that goals are there to serve the vision.
- [ ] Add the roadmap.
<issue_comment>username_0: Preview here: https://deploy-preview-189--asyncapi-website.netlify.app/roadmap
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 Looking great, but I don't see any link from navigation to go to roadmap. Is it intentional?
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 yes, it's an early version. I'll add it to the navigation later.
<issue_comment>username_0: Good point. I will!
<issue_comment>username_0: I have to admit this is probably not the kind of road map some people are looking for. Let me try to go a bit deeper in terms of ideas we want to explore.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 I think it all depends on the audience, like who is that for. Is it for the community? because the community asks specific questions, ""when we will have this or that"", ""when we plan to work on this issue"", ""when we will enable this"". For me roadmap is ""you know where you go, and these are the steps"". From vision, we clearly know where we are going and I love it. Just for me step = action, you take this step and then another, `User is able to focus only on business logic` is definitely not a step, especially after you explained it, you see that even I didn't get it and immediately thought it is just about model generation and that this one soon will be solved. For me, this is like an item on a more granular vision.

I hope you know what I mean, I'm basically doing a community guardian job here. ""Product"" must have vision and roadmap, but users need a list of action points, a pipeline of stuff, ordered, like ""this is for 2020"" (just few items) and ""this is for later"" (with clear annotation saying ""this is super dynamic, you want to push something faster, join us""). 

I just think that most people, when they ask for the roadmap, they ask for a list of things they want to do or can be affected by. 

Take for example HTML template and react component. If I would be outside the core team, I would be super interested to know in advance on what we plan to do there and when, so I can plan my stuff. `Deprecate html-template and improve asyncapi-react` is an item I would expect, one line that can clearly tell me if this is important for me or not.

Yes, I know roadmap != backlog, but they should be aligned (and best if combined in one view.

Now, when I look at 👇🏼 

![Screenshot 2021-03-05 at 13 18 08](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6995927/110114627-4085df80-7db5-11eb-8b1d-a64628c951d1.png)

The black ones are the details people expect, backlog items that will be handled. And it is linked to the roadmap item, which is perfect. Just that this roadmap item is very generic, and something that can never be finished if it is not scoped.

Am I getting somewhere here? do you know what I mean?



btw, I forgot to mention that at the end it is as you planned, based on GitHub issues, so always, in the end, if something is not clear, a not shy community member can always click and comment on the issue ❤️
<issue_comment>username_2: My above comment in short:

- vision 💪🏼 
- design of the `roadmap` view ❤️ 
- way you map roadmap items to actions 😗 
- powered by GitHub issues, roadmap auto-updates  🚀 

just in my opinion, some items are missing and some are too generic.
<issue_comment>username_0: I think we're aligned. Let me just add one more step. I think it's important to keep these ""generic"" outcomes. They're not generic, they're concrete. But not concrete things anyone can jump and do but instead concrete problems we want to solve.

The reason you're seeing it generic now is that:

1. You're looking at it from a task description point of view. And like you, many people will look at it like this.
2. It's missing one step in the middle. Usually called ""Solution"" or ""Idea"". So, for instance, `User is able to focus only on business logic` will get 3 actionable items: a. CLI to create AsyncAPI files interactively; b. Improve Generator so people don't have to worry about models; c. Create a framework that uses an AsyncAPI file as a config file and automatically does everything for you.

In this case, 2.b. will then be mapped to the features that are now there in black. I hope I'm making myself understandable here 😄 It should be easy to understand once you see it and still will be Github issues.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 should we then be in rush to merge? wouldn't it be better if you just work on those descriptions and then we merge?
<issue_comment>username_0: Yeah, let's hold it for now.
<issue_comment>username_0: @jonaslagoni I'd prefer to have the research there as well, to show the full story. It's part of the task in the end.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 how about this way of visualizing the relationship now? https://deploy-preview-189--asyncapi-website.netlify.app/roadmap.

I'm thinking now:

* Add a box explaining this is our road map but anyone can contribute and solve something any time.
* Adding an icon with a question mark next to Solution and Feature tags to clarify their meaning.
* Completing issues descriptions.
* Record a video explaining the roadmap for those who don't like to read. (this may be another PR so it's not blocking)
<issue_comment>username_2: that would be amazing and yes, can be added later and embedded from youtube. Totally another PR
<issue_comment>username_0: No, we don't but it improves readability. Try it yourself, remove the colors. It becomes very ""schematic"".

yeap, hard to distinguish, but maybe just entire columns could be framed, have border color like green, etc? 

nevertheless to many colors is too much, requires additional legend for colors. So even if you leave colors for now, later, future, then at least remove legend as it is not needed
<issue_comment>username_0: I'd not remove the legend, it's especially useful in mobile where there are no columns. May be obvious for some but prefer to make it clearer.
