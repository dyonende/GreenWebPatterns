Your handle_call is wrong. You are returning only the ‚Äúnames‚Äù as the state, instead of the {names, refs} tuple, causing further invocations to fail. :)<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_0: Wow, that was so simple. I should definitely be more careful in reading over the example code in the tutorial. Thank you!"

I just wanted to point out that there is a mistake in the listing as the wallet does support Token Swaps but the features card says it doesn't.

Also, if possible could the background colour for the logo be changed from white to #3F3F3F or should we submit a logo with this background?

Thank you for your help."
