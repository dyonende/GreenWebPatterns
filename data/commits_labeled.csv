In the last 2 years, I have had the great pleasure to be part of the community building this amazing open-source tool. I am quite satisfied in feeling that I left a small dent in the overall experience for new users.

Today I see my path take a different course, which I am excited to invest my full energy into. ??

I was also very lucky to work on Canonical's distribution - which I leave in the great hands of @knkski  @DomFleischmann and more. 

If you want to stay in touch, please connect via LinkedIn.

I nominate @knkski to take on some of the responsibilities I held, in his own capacity, given his 3 years of dedication to Kubeflow.

When a project uses “continuous deployment powered by Cloud Build”,
the deployment is a little bit too continuous: when multiple commits
land in a short time window, Cloud Build will run all the triggered
build jobs in parallel. If each job does “gcloud app deploy”, there
is no guarantee which will win: perhaps an older commit will complete
last, resulting in the newest commit not actually being the final
deployed version of the site. This should probably be fixed in
“continuous deployment powered by Cloud Build”, but until then,
locktrigger works around the problem.

Use locktrigger in cmd/golangorg/cloudbuild.yaml to ensure that
when multiple commits race, the newest one always runs its
go-app-deploy.sh last.

outreachy/website;7a688b4e64b3dc2e3037c30d9392a467ce7fc07b;"Initial application: Attempt to clarify instructions on contractor questions

The form is still a mess. The verbose name and help text mention ""hours
spent contacting"" not ""hours per week"". The form promises that you'll be
able to provide actual hours on the next part of the form. That's not
true, I think? There's no additional form after this, unless it's the
volunteer time commitments section.

So the models still need work for this section. TODO:
 - add a description field so people can say what kind of contracting or
   consulting they do
 - remove unhelpful field help text that contradicts the instructions I
   just wrote

I could expand the form processing loop and over-write the verbose name
and help text. But I'm running out of energy and time. It's good enough,
sorry applicants...";0

features ? feature
> There is nothing ""bad"" about using state or lifecycle hooks in components. Like any powerful feature**s**, they should be used in moderation, but we have no intention to remove them.

I can’t explain the exact grammatical principle this violates, but it sounds wrong to my native English ears that “feature” is plural here. Another way to check if the grammar sounds right is to change the order of the clauses: ”They should be used in moderation, like any powerful feature“ sounds right, whereas “They should be used in moderation, like any powerful features” does not.";0

fluxcd/website;e42a87ce6f1fb55d9370b87d74f7491d87ddd085;"add coreutils to docker-support/Dockerfile

* tail --lines=+2 in hack/import-flux2-assets.sh

does not work with busybox tail

* Run ""make docker-push-support""
  to rebuild from docker-support/ and push a new image to the repo

(This change will require the maintainer to run this command,
to update the fluxcd/website docker support container images.)

* refactor docker build

It should be a bit easier for the maintainer to push a change to the
docker-support image (you should basically never need to rebuild hugo,
which unfortunately takes 5-10 minutes even on a fast machine.)

This is not a big deal but if someone finds a problem with the docker
support image and they can't actually test and contribute a simple fix
like adding the coreutils package without spending 10 mins needlessly
building the same version of hugo we already are using, that's not a
very good contrib-experience.

* add support for remote builder

Especially when on a slow or remote network, or if your workstation is
underpowered, it can be extremely useful to invoke a remote builder.

I wanted to use a remote builder because I'm on a slow network. I don't
expect most people to use this, but it's there, (I used it, it worked!)

* make docker-push-support

Put regular docker things back (don't use okteto build or okteto push)

<p>A few years ago you had to work hard to succeed in some fields. Nowadays you don’t need to work hard but to work smart. So this means that most of the time laziness (of course not extremely) is useful for our productivity. On the other hand, laziness is extremely important when you work with a large amount of data and reduced space or power. In this talk we will try to cover all aspects of laziness in Kotlin: starting from lazy initialization of properties using delegates, lazy collections, sequences and, finally, laziness with coroutines. The main thing we would like to talk about is how to use this laziness and be productive with it. To see one more benefit of laziness in Kotlin we’ll refactor a real application to use lazy calculations.</p>

<p>Kotlin is the new JVM language where all the best practices of programming come together. Looking forward to discover a language that will support you in writing readable and understandable code in the fewest lines possible? Without any help of any extra libraries such as Lombok, Guava and even more, Kotlin will challenge you to write code that even the business analyst should be able to understand. With Kotlin you can finally focus on the business features you want to implement instead working on the language itself. In this workshop, you will build a simple webservice in Kotlin and hopefully see how easy it can be to write new business functionality.
- Exercise 1 : (data) classes, collections and types
- Exercise 2 : inheritance, interfaces and extension functions
- Exercise 3 : how to integrate Kotlin with Spring</p>

<p>One of the most popular Java books is 'Effective Java' from Joshua Bloch, which describes how to avoid common mistakes, how to deal with Java's weaknesses, and how best practices for the language look like. When Jetbrains started to create a 'better Java' with Kotlin, a lot of ideas about how to make a better language came from the information of 'Effective Java' and lots of design decisions are based on the book. In this talk the audience will learn how the book influenced the language design and the compiler of Kotlin and in what way the book is deeply ingrained into the language.</p>

<p>Bien que la création d'applications inter-plates-formes complètes puisse souvent s'avérer être une mauvaise idée, une logique spécifique à un client peut grandement bénéficier d'un code unique, permettant à la fois d'écrire et de tester le code. Depuis fin 2016, Kotlin/Native peut compiler du code Kotlin sous une forme binaire, qui peut ensuite être intégrée dans une application native. Dans cette présentation, vous apprendrez pourquoi il est logique et efficace d'exploiter ces fonctionnalités expérimentales et de créer un module multi-plateforme réutilisable sur Android et iOS.</p>

gohugoio/hugo;80230f26a3020ff33bac2bef01b2c0e314b89f86;"Add support for theme composition and inheritance

This commit adds support for theme composition and inheritance in Hugo.

With this, it helps thinking about a theme as a set of ordered components:

```toml
theme = [""my-shortcodes"", ""base-theme"", ""hyde""]
```

The theme definition example above in `config.toml` creates a theme with the 3 components with presedence from left to right.

So, Hugo will, for any given file, data entry etc., look first in the project, and then in `my-shortcode`, `base-theme` and lastly `hyde`.

Hugo uses two different algorithms to merge the filesystems, depending on the file type:

* For `i18n` and `data` files, Hugo merges deeply using the translation id and data key inside the files.
* For `static`, `layouts` (templates) and `archetypes` files, these are merged on file level. So the left-most file will be chosen.

The name used in the `theme` definition above must match a folder in `/your-site/themes`, e.g. `/your-site/themes/my-shortcodes`. There are  plans to improve on this and get a URL scheme so this can be resolved automatically.

Also note that a component that is part of a theme can have its own configuration file, e.g. `config.toml`. There are currently some restrictions to what a theme component can configure:

* `params` (global and per language)
* `menu` (global and per language)
* `outputformats` and `mediatypes`

The same rules apply here: The left-most param/menu etc. with the same ID will win. There are some hidden and experimental namespace support in the above, which we will work to improve in the future, but theme authors are encouraged to create their own namespaces to avoid naming conflicts.

A final note: Themes/components can also have a `theme` definition in their `config.toml` and similar, which is the ""inheritance"" part of this commit's title. This is currently not supported by the Hugo theme site. We will have to wait for some ""auto dependency"" feature to be implemented for that to happen, but this can be a powerful feature if you want to create your own theme-variant based on others.

gohugoio/hugo;dea71670c059ab4d5a42bd22503f18c087dd22d4;"Add Hugo Piper with SCSS support and much more

Before this commit, you would have to use page bundles to do image processing etc. in Hugo.

This commit adds

* A new `/assets` top-level project or theme dir (configurable via `assetDir`)
* A new template func, `resources.Get` which can be used to ""get a resource"" that can be further processed.

This means that you can now do this in your templates (or shortcodes):

```bash
{{ $sunset := (resources.Get ""images/sunset.jpg"").Fill ""300x200"" }}
```

This also adds a new `extended` build tag that enables powerful SCSS/SASS support with source maps. To compile this from source, you will also need a C compiler installed:

```
HUGO_BUILD_TAGS=extended mage install
```

Note that you can use output of the SCSS processing later in a non-SCSSS-enabled Hugo.

The `SCSS` processor is a _Resource transformation step_ and it can be chained with the many others in a pipeline:

```bash
{{ $css := resources.Get ""styles.scss"" | resources.ToCSS | resources.PostCSS | resources.Minify | resources.Fingerprint }}
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""{{ $styles.RelPermalink }}"" integrity=""{{ $styles.Data.Digest }}"" media=""screen"">
```

The transformation funcs above have aliases, so it can be shortened to:

```bash
{{ $css := resources.Get ""styles.scss"" | toCSS | postCSS | minify | fingerprint }}
<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""{{ $styles.RelPermalink }}"" integrity=""{{ $styles.Data.Digest }}"" media=""screen"">
```

A quick tip would be to avoid the fingerprinting part, and possibly also the not-superfast `postCSS` when you're doing development, as it allows Hugo to be smarter about the rebuilding.

Documentation will follow, but have a look at the demo repo in https://github.com/bep/hugo-sass-test

New functions to create `Resource` objects:

* `resources.Get` (see above)
* `resources.FromString`: Create a Resource from a string.

New `Resource` transformation funcs:

* `resources.ToCSS`: Compile `SCSS` or `SASS` into `CSS`.
* `resources.PostCSS`: Process your CSS with PostCSS. Config file support (project or theme or passed as an option).
* `resources.Minify`: Currently supports `css`, `js`, `json`, `html`, `svg`, `xml`.
* `resources.Fingerprint`: Creates a fingerprinted version of the given Resource with Subresource Integrity..
* `resources.Concat`: Concatenates a list of Resource objects. Think of this as a poor man's bundler.
* `resources.ExecuteAsTemplate`: Parses and executes the given Resource and data context (e.g. .Site) as a Go template.

Apparently, two instances of ""choco install mingw"" running simultaneously
(for go-version 1.18.x and 1.19.x) would often cause at least one of them
to fail to connect to SourceForge:

    ERROR: The remote file either doesn't exist, is unauthorized,
    or is forbidden for url

    Exception calling ""GetResponse"" with ""0"" argument(s):

With Choco-Install however, it simply works every single time!

This patch adds a wait when powering on a vm so setupVirtualMachine does
not return until the vm is actually powered on.  This allows other
functions to work off the assumption that the current state of the vm
is not in flux. During resourceVSphereVirtualMachineRead(), the wait for
IP would cause a hang for any VM with no network interfaces or for vms
that had been powered off for any reason.  This also means that the user
could not delete a vm with no network interfaces or that is powered off.

As of December 18, 2020, we've redirected nearly all of the provider
documentation. For providers that never got adopted by a new publisher, we
archived the GitHub repository and redirected each docs page to the
corresponding Markdown source file on github.com. (For an example of these
redirects, see https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/telefonicaopencloud/r/s3_bucket.html)

This commit removes the submodules, layout symlinks, docs folder symlinks, and
incoming-links.txt entries for every provider that we've redirected on prod.
Namely, the following:

- arukas
- azure
- bitbucket
- cherryservers
- clc
- cloudstack
- cohesity
- dyn
- hedvig
- ignition
- incapsula
- influxdb
- jdcloud
- librato
- logentries
- logicmonitor
- metalcloud
- netlify
- oneandone
- powerdns
- pureport
- rancher
- rightscale
- runscope
- softlayer
- statuscake
- telefonicaopencloud
- ultradns

It leaves ten provider submodules in place, since those are gonna get published
on the registry but still need a little bit of time:

- avi
- chef
- cobbler
- genymotion
- github
- infoblox
- ksyun

hashicorp/terraform-website;580e7fbfc0075746f2fb64828bfc0ebf789abfe1;"CI: Add more trustworthy link checking for pull requests (#1574)

This commit adds a Ruby script and a CircleCI workflow for checking links in
*only the changed files* on a branch. The goal is to give a clear signal if you
introduce new broken links in a PR, with a minimum of false positives or (real)
problems that are unrelated to your changes.

DETAILS AND CAVEATS:

- We rely on Git to decide which files we're checking, and we calculate it
  differently per repo:

    - In terraform-website, we compare against the most recent common ancestor
      of the PR branch and master.

    - In terraform core, not everything merges to master (due to long-lived
      branches like v0.14), so we need to figure out which branch you're
      probably PRing to first.

- This only checks links in the *content area* of docs pages. It doesn't check
  nav sidebars or the top/bottom navs.

- No special handling for the new Vercel routes, so links to those from content
  will be false positives.

- We don't implement redirects, because you should update those links to their
  new destinations anyway.

- There are some easy optimization targets in the script that I didn't bother
  reaching for; caching, basically. Easy to add later, but right now the script
  time is WAY overshadowed by container pull and checkout time, so who cares.

CONTEXT AND REASONING:

We do a global, spidering link check for terraform.io whenever we deploy the
site. But a global link check sucks for pull requests:

- It catches links that have *nothing to do* with your PR, and which you, the PR
  author, might not have the power to do anything about.
- Since it can't run against prod, it gets too many false positives for things like our Vercel routes. 
- Takes too long.

So our current PR link checking is useless, mostly due to the ""someone else did
that"" issue and the false positives for top nav items and redirects -- it's
always red and never actionable, so we just ignore it.

Our requirements for a good PR link checker are: 

- Only checks files that are relevant to that PR. 
- False negatives should be rare, but aren't the end of the world -- we regularly run a global link check anyway.
- False positives should be rare enough that people don't stop paying attention to the CI. 

After investigating a bunch of alternatives, it turned out that the easiest
fix was to just write our own link checker script in Ruby. Which sounds wild, but:

- In this particular case, our tolerance for false positives/negatives means we can keep 
the script quite simple. (A complete solution in the link-checking problem space is hard, 
but an incomplete one is easy.)

- Ruby and Nokogiri are already in our dependencies because of Middleman, so no extra overhead.

- On the other hand, getting any OTHER language stack into our
  Middleman container would require rearchitecting that container from the
  ground up, which would be a poor investment.

- CircleCI lets us run a background server and a foreground task in the same container, which 
greatly simplifies the necessary configuration. 

- All the off-the-shelf link checkers I investigated (about five or six of
  them) would have required additional tooling anyway, probably at a similar level 
  of effort/complexity as this new script.";0

A longstanding secret feature of TFC is that you can specify a version
constraint as the Terraform version for a workspace, if you're using the API or
provider.

A longstanding documented-but-discouraged feature is that you can specify the
special keyword ""latest"" and have it always use the latest version.

This commit removes a reference to the special ""latest"" keyword, but in exchange
it documents the version constraints feature for power users.";0

</ul>
<h2>2.1.36 - 08 Dec 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.5. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1412"">#1412</a></li>
<li>Add a step that tries to upload a SARIF file for the workflow run
when that workflow run fails. This will help better surface failed code
scanning workflow runs. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1393"">#1393</a></li>
<li>Python automatic dependency installation will no longer consider
dependecy code installed in venv as user-written, for projects using
Poetry that specify <code>virtualenvs.in-project = true</code> in their
<code>poetry.toml</code>. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1419"">#1419</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>2.1.35 - 01 Dec 2022</h2>
<p>No user facing changes.</p>
<h2>2.1.34 - 25 Nov 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.4. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1391"">#1391</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some the <code>init</code> action and the
<code>analyze</code> action would have different sets of experimental
feature flags enabled. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1384"">#1384</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.1.33 - 16 Nov 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>Go is now analyzed in the same way as other compiled languages such
as C/C++, C#, and Java. This completes the rollout of the feature
described in <a
href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/#2127---06-oct-2022"">CodeQL
Action version 2.1.27</a>. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1322"">#1322</a></li>
<li>Bump the minimum CodeQL bundle version to 2.6.3. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1358"">#1358</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.1.32 - 14 Nov 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.11.3. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1348"">#1348</a></li>

version 0.4.0. <a

</ul>
<h2>2.1.31 - 04 Nov 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li>The <code>rb/weak-cryptographic-algorithm</code> Ruby query has been
updated to no longer report uses of hash functions such as
<code>MD5</code> and <code>SHA1</code> even if they are known to be
weak. These hash algorithms are used very often in non-sensitive
contexts, making the query too imprecise in practice. For more
information, see the corresponding change in the <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql/pull/11129"">github/codeql
repository</a>. <a
href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1344"">#1344</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.1.30 - 02 Nov 2022</h2>

earlier in a workflow that runs on a runner image such as
<code>ubuntu-22.04</code> that uses glibc version 2.34 and later. <a

</ul>
<h2>2.1.29 - 26 Oct 2022</h2>

<h1>CodeQL Action Changelog</h1>
<p>See the <a
href=""https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases"">releases
page</a> for the relevant changes to the CodeQL CLI and language
packs.</p>
<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a workaround for Python 3.12, which is not supported in CodeQL
CLI version 2.14.6 or earlier. If you are running an analysis on Windows
and using Python 3.12 or later, the CodeQL Action will switch to running
Python 3.11. In this case, if Python 3.11 is not found, then the
workflow will fail. <a

</ul>
<h2>2.22.0 - 06 Oct 2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>The CodeQL Action now requires CodeQL version 2.10.5 or later. For
more information, see the corresponding changelog entry for CodeQL
Action version 2.21.8. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1907"">#1907</a></li>
<li>The CodeQL Action no longer runs ML-powered queries. For more
information, including details on our investment in AI-powered security
technology, see <a
href=""https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-29-codeql-code-scanning-deprecates-ml-powered-alerts/"">&quot;CodeQL

href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1910"">#1910</a></li>
<li>Fix a bug which prevented tracing of projects using Go 1.21 and
above on Linux. <a

</ul>
<h2>2.21.9 - 27 Sep 2023</h2>

success rate of C/C++ autobuild. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1889"">#1889</a></li>
<li>We are rolling out a feature in October 2023 that will provide
specific file coverage information for C and C++, Java and Kotlin, and
JavaScript and TypeScript. Currently file coverage information for each
of these pairs of languages is grouped together. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1903"">#1903</a></li>
<li>Add a warning to help customers avoid inadvertently analyzing the
same CodeQL language in multiple matrix jobs. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1901"">#1901</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.21.8 - 19 Sep 2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.10.4
and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 12 September
2023 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.6, and will be unsupported by
the next minor release of the CodeQL Action. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1884"">#1884</a>
<ul>
<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI
version 2.10.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom
version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can
remove this input to use the default version.</li>
<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL
CLI between 2.9.5 and 2.10.4, you can replace
<code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by
<code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.21.7</code> in your code scanning
workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL
Action.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enable the following language aliases when using CodeQL 2.14.4 and
later: <code>c-cpp</code> for C/C++ analysis, <code>java-kotlin</code>
for Java/Kotlin analysis, and <code>javascript-typescript</code> for
JavaScript/TypeScript analysis. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1883"">#1883</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.21.7 - 14 Sep 2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.5. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1882"">#1882</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.21.6 - 13 Sep 2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>Better error message when there is a failure to determine the merge
base of the code to analysis. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1860"">#1860</a></li>
<li>Improve the calculation of default amount of RAM used for query
execution on GitHub Enterprise Server. This now reduces in proportion to
the runner's total memory to better account for system memory usage,
helping to avoid out-of-memory failures on larger runners. This feature
is already available to GitHub.com users. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1866"">#1866</a></li>
<li>Enable improved file coverage information for GitHub Enterprise
Server users. This feature is already available to GitHub.com users. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1867"">#1867</a></li>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.4. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1873"">#1873</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.21.5 - 28 Aug 2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.3. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1845"">#1845</a></li>
<li>Fixed a bug in CodeQL Action 2.21.3 onwards that affected beta
support for <a href=""https://projectlombok.org/"">Project Lombok</a> when
analyzing Java. The environment variable
<code>CODEQL_EXTRACTOR_JAVA_RUN_ANNOTATION_PROCESSORS</code> will now be
respected if it was manually configured in the workflow. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1844"">#1844</a></li>
<li>Enable support for Kotlin 1.9.20 when running with CodeQL CLI
v2.13.4 through v2.14.3. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1853"">#1853</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>2.21.4 - 14 Aug 2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.14.2. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1831"">#1831</a></li>
<li>Log a warning if the amount of available disk space runs low during
a code scanning run. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1825"">#1825</a></li>
<li>When downloading CodeQL bundle version 2.13.4 and later, cache these
bundles in the Actions tool cache using a simpler version number. <a
href=""https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1832"">#1832</a></li>

RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge;ee78e7613fa6ceeb7cfebf91a2b2fe0a202ad68b;"[contents] Replace file_get_contents by cURL

cURL is a powerful library specifically designed to connect to many
different types of servers with different types of protocols. For
more detailed information refer to the PHP cURL manual:

- http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php

Due to this change some parameters for the getContents function were
necessary (also applies to getSimpleHTMLDOM and getSimpleHTMLDOMCached):

> $use_include_path removed

  This parameter has never been used and doesn't even make sense in
  this context; If set to true file_get_contents would also search
  for files in the include_path (specified in php.ini).

> $context replaced by $header and $opts

  The $context parameter allowed for customization of the request in
  order to change how file_get_contents would acquire the data (i.e.
  using POST instead of GET, sending custom header, etc...)

  cURL also provides facilities to specify custom headers and change
  how it communicates to severs. cURL, however, is much more advanced.

  - $header is an optional parameter (empty by default). It receives
    an array of strings to send in the HTTP request header.

    See 'CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER':

    ""An array of HTTP header fields to set, in the format
    array('Content-type: text/plain', 'Content-length: 100')""

    - php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php

  - $opts is an optional parameter (empty by default). It receives
    an array of options, where each option is a key-value-pair of
    a cURL option (CURLOPT_*) and it's associated parameter. This
    parameter accepts any of the CURLOPT_* settings.

    Example (sending POST instead of GET):

    $opts = array(
      CURLOPT_POST => 1,
      CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS => '&action=none'
    );
    $html = getContents($url, array(), $opts);

    Refer to the cURL setopt manual for more information:
    - php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php

> $offset and $maxlen removed

  These options were supported by file_get_contents, but there doesn't
  seem to be an equivalent in cURL. Since no caller uses them they are
  safe to remove.

Compressed data / Encoding

  By using cURL instead of file_get_contents RSS-Bridge no longer has
  to handle compressed data manually.

  See 'CURLOPT_ENCODING':

  ""[...] Supported encodings are ""identity"", ""deflate"", and ""gzip"".
  If an empty string, """", is set, a header containing all supported
  encoding types is sent.""

  - http://php.net/manual/en/function.curl-setopt.php

  Notice: By default all encoding types are accepted (""""). This can
  be changed by setting a custom option via $opts.

    Example:

    $opts = array(CURLOPT_ENCODING => 'gzip');
    $html = getContents($url, array(), $opts);

Proxy

The proxy implementation should still work, but there doesn't seem
to be an equivalent for 'request_fulluri = true'. To my understanding
this isn't an issue because cURL knows how to handle proxy communication.";0

    Create a Chart componenet to hold reseources of a single chart (#197)

    * Create a Chart componenet to hold reseources of a single chart

    This eliminates the need of random dom id and tracking them in chart region. It also get rid of the flashing effect when updating places and stats vars.

    * Fix string selector bug

    * clean up

Bevy is a community-driven people-first project. We do not have a business model. We don't sell anything. For now, we don't even have a centralized legal organization. Instead, our work is fully supported by sponsorships from generous individuals and companies. But introducing money into the equation creates concerns about power dynamics and incentives. And some companies require contracts as a part of their sponsorship programs. Bevy leaders (Project Leads and Maintainers) _must serve the community's interests above all else_. Therefore leaders that accept any money within the context of Bevy must abide by the following pledge:

The @bevyengine/maintainer-team has agreed to (and helped iterate on) this pledge. Maintainers, please create a new PR after this one is merged to sign this and add relevant disclosures.

Data Mechanics Delight is a free, hosted, cross-platform monitoring tool for Apache Spark. It is powered by an open-source Spark agent which works on top of any type of Spark infrastructure (commercial or open-source, in the cloud or on-premise, etc).

The project is live as of November 2020 and will get significant improvement over the following weeks -- right now it is a dashboard giving you access to the Spark UI (Spark History Server), but we will soon add new debugging screens with memory and CPU metrics to complement and improve on the Spark UI.

We hope the Spark community will really benefit from this tool, and so we'd love to be listed on this page.

# PUG
## index.pug

The multiple and slide variants/containers were taken out and replaced by the improvement container. The latter is cleaner and easier to read, and takes less user imput for the same output.

The rectangle containers were improved so they take less space and look somewhat cleaner.

Other unused classes/code was cleaned for better readability.
## default.pug
a link was added to the FAF logo on the footer, favicon image was also added.

# SASS
## _navigation.sass

Font sizes were all decreased so the website is easier to read and less on the ""face"" of the user.

FAF logo on the footer is now aligned with the other footer elements.

## index.sass
Creation of the styling of the improvement container, made the thinContainer titles have a z-index so the splat doesn't overlap them. Made other images and items smaller for better readability.

# Images
Some images were changed/updated to have a correct size ration for the rectangle container (from 1:1 to 16:9).

* Navigation Page Update (#349)

# PUG
## index.pug
Fixed small bug with thin container being overlapped by splat img.
## default.pug
Added FAF logo to mobile navbar.

# SASS
## _navigation.sass

Mobile navbar received some styling updates, icons and text got more padding for less mistakes in smartphone touch. Created styling for the FAF logo on mobile navbar.

## index.sass
Improved improvement container so its responsive to screen size (making itself 3, 2 or 1 columns depending on how big the screen is).

# Images
New faction and resource pattern images added for mobile navbar

# JS

Fixed issues with ACU cards caused by the previous deletion of other elements on the pug page (multiple and slide containers) without the deletion of their javascript functions. Causing JS to stop working due to not finding elements that don't exist.

* $Variables (#351)

# PUG
### ai.pug
Made the rectangle containers more compact (again, less on the ""face"" of the reader).

### default.pug
Made a comment in a nav_absolute that seems misplaced but isn't.

# SASS
### _navigation.sass and index.sass

Starting to update most of the css variable var(--) for the better $variable used by sass. This is being done so @Mixins can be used soon.

### mixins.sass
Cleared out of unused Mixins and updated to become the current variable.sass. It doesn't have any mixins but depending on the amount of mixins used, I might just not make a different page for variables and one for mixins (less pages = better).

### _mixins.sass and _footer.sass
Both deleted as they are out of use.

# JS
### index.js
Made extra comments so JS is even clearer and updated the pulsating function to work without var(--) (JS can't use $color because it will render $color into the css rather than the actual color variable. Ergo, manual colors were used).

#Images
### footerbanner.jpg
Updated to a better version of it that will be better displayed on smaller screens.

* Preparing for Localisation Support (#352)

- Adds the Following to package.json : i18next,i18next-browser-languagedetector, i18next-fs-backend, i18next-http-middleware
- Updates yarn.lock
- Added Initialisation to express.js of i18n Support
- Added locales' folder structure
- Added translation.json files to locales folders

* Minor fixes & Add new Pages (#353)

- index.pug removed # calls with . notation
- index.sass removed # calls with . notation
- Added patchnotes.js & patchnotes.pug & updated express.js Accordingly

* The fix for the fix (#354)

# PUG and SASS
### index.pug #index.sass
Just re-adding some # that were necessary for IDs in the JS

* @use mixins (#356)

* #@use and mixins

## PUG and SASS
### index.pug #index.sass
Added mixins.$variables (the correct way, rather than just $variable).

Renamed the split containers to grid. Grid is a much more fitting name than split for the ""template"" of the grid containers.

## _mixins.sass
Received some new mixins.

## _navigation.sass
Deleted alot of unnecessary 0px (px not needed) to clean up the Problems tab and rid the code of every ""problem"" it had.

## site.sass and deletion
_mobile.sass, _fonts.sass and _elements.sass were deleted due to not being used and to clear space.

site.sass now uses (once more) @use rather than @import. This is due to the fact that @import is being deprecated this year and replaced by @use.

* @use and mixins

* Code Cleanup (#357)

##PUG and SASS

Code was improved with SASS and older code was deleted/changed to use less lines for the same output.

ACU container received a well deserving update

##JS

cleaned up old JS of ACU container but currently it doesn't work perfectly. Whoever wants to fix it can get a cookie lol.

* Update README.md (#358)

- Added Public POEditor link for site translation

* Language Tab + JS Fix (#359)

##PUG and SASS
### Navigation (default.pug, _navigation.sass)

A language tab has been added since Rowey is working on adding multi-language capabilities to the website.

##JS
### index.js
The faction containers got fixed and now work plus they have new hover and active animations.

* Re-structuring + Cleanup (#360)

## Deletion
Files deleted were 99% related to the styling of the website. Due to the new development of the website, these style sheets don't work anymore unless I stick to the naming conventions and previous work done. However, a great part of these files either seem to bear no purpose or are inefficient (such as using static sizes for the size or width of elements, making them non-responsive to changes in screen size).

## JS
### index.js
Gave the language navigation it's own JS, trying to make it respond to click rather than hover but its a work in progress.

## PUG
### index.pug
Added comments for clarity
### newshub.pug
Starting to toy around with it, trying to understand the logic and way it was structured so we can update the newshub. I would just re-do it from start but the code being used from wordpress and the json is far too advanced for us to re-do at the moment.

### ai.pug
Making the contents more compact so they are easier to read

### tutorials-guides.pug
Creation of page, work in progress.

## JS
### index.js
The faction containers got fixed and now work plus they have new hover and active animations.

## SASS
Small changes done to the styling of the pages, changed margins and fixed other issues.

* Update README.md (#361)

- Replaced Image with new Frontend

* Banners and Pages (#362)

## PUG
### default.pug
Through a mixin banner and the use of blocks, now I have created a template for all the banners that is very easy to configure across the board. You will see almost all pug pages now have their own banner with images and text.

The navbar has also become a bit smaller and Kazbek's statistics removed from it.
### index.pug
Small changes and the removal of Kazbek's player statistics from the FAF Improvements section.

## SASS
### Overall
Small styling changes, made the rectangle container a mixin so it can be added in multiple places yet changed on each page.

### _variables.sass
Despite it containing unused content. This styling sheet now contains the current used variables. Therefore, _mixins.sass currently only has mixins and not both mixins and variables

## Images
Images have been added/updated for the new banners every page has.

## Deletion
Jquery was deleted since it wasn't being used.

* Banners and Pages (#363)

## Content Creator Page
This update is just the creation of the content needed for the content creator page, it using a pug mixin and being pretty much ""completed"" for now.
## default.pug
The navbar received some re-ordering so it is ordered by longest to shortest text, giving it a cleaner look.

## Elsewhere
Not much was changed, maybe I created the sass files needed for certain pages but nothing significant was done.

* FAF TEAMS (#364)

## FAF TEAMS
This update is just the creation of the content needed for the faf teams page, it using a pug mixin and being pretty much ""completed"" for now.

* Leaderboard (WIP) (made with @MrRowey) (#375)

## Leaderboard
Current work to ""recreate"" the leaderboards.

* Game Server Player Counter (#378)

Added back in the player counter to the main page

Co-authored-by: MrRowey <roweyfaf@gmail.com>

* Fixed default.pug not working (#380)

## default.pug
Small fix to default.pug so @MrRowey can continue to work on the player counter.

## index.pug
JS was on the same indentation as a block content and so it wasnt working. I indented so it works.

* 1V1 (#382)

* Fixed default.pug not working
## default.pug
Small fix to default.pug so @MrRowey can continue to work on the player counter.

## index.pug
JS was on the same indentation as a block content and so it wasnt working. I indented so it works.

* 1v1 Leaderboard
## PUG
index.pug and default.pug both received updates so only the index page shows the amount of players currently online.

leaderboards.pug received some IDs in order to be able to receive the js from leaderboards.js adequately.

## JS
leaderboards.js received the JS needed to be able to pull the data from 1v1.json and make the leaderboard for 1v1. Currently, it only supports the first 100 players, soon a First, last, previous and next buttons will be added.

## Other scripts
Certain changes that were very minor were done on extractor.js, getRecentUsers.js and so on were done so the files from the API are placed in the correct folder.

## PUG
Small changes to naming and the addition of certain IDs in certain elements for their use in js (for example, the global container having a #globalLeaderboard Id so it can be called in js when its clicked)

## JS
### Creation of the Pagination
The complete creation of the next, previous and switch of leaderboard type (currently only global). This was done through just removing the previous contents with the'delete' class and re-adding the new ones which then would be changed either to the next 100 players or the previous 100. Huge thanks to both @MrRowey and @Sheikah

## Other scripts
Small change done to updateLeagues.js so it moves the clans.json to the correct members folder and also adding a .gitignore to it so the json files dont get commited.

## Styling

This update brings a lot of styling changes to the leaderboards and small tweaks to the size of the nav bar and other things.

## Functionality
Now all 4 leaderboards are operational with their own searchbar that can compare across the board. It is still a work in progress to get the missing player issue working.

## Bigger Reason
This commit is being done since my PC is having issues and I want to keep a safe copy of my work before its too late.

* Leaderboards Completed

## SASS Changes
Deletion of unused classes, cleanup of leaderboards styling, the adding of other classes that were needed for the new dropdown buttons.

## JS Changes
The leaderboard finally is fully operational. With a time filter, search function, matchmaker filter and a clean UI that works both in desktop and mobile screen sizes.

Alot of the previous JS was trimmed and made much more compact, so the leaderboards.js are occupying as least space as needed and now can be read much more easily.

## PUG

Small changes done to certain naming classes and Ids for a cleaner and easier to read file.

* Leaderboards and Extractor

## JS
Improvements made to the extractor.js file, made far more compact and using less packages and way less code repetition.

leaderboards.js also had improvements thanks to @Louvenarde's review on how to do certain processes on a more efficient manner (such as using flooring instead of slicing to get the last page of the leaderboards). Also updated to reflect the new changes done on extractor.js.

## Node-fetch
installed so we could use fetch to call API.

## AI Page
Deletion of the LOUD honorable mention due to the association's decision on the annual meeting.

* Fix Development Environment Issues (#392)

## Fix
We commented out localization support for the time being and fixed other issues in other files due to missing package variables (such as let = require('moment').

* Navbar old (#393)

* Fix Development Environment Issues

## Fix
We commented out localization support for the time being and fixed other issues in other files due to missing package variables (such as let = require('moment').

* Navigation Bar 2.0
# Navigation
## Desktop Navbar
Received some minor updates, having the same core structure but a new fade animation added to its menus. Now both the topnavbar and the desktop navbar share the same color for a more unified structure.

The PLAY NOW button was reduced to a DOWNLOAD button.

FAF NEWS > NEWS

and the removal of other elements inside the GAME, COMMUNITY And COMPETITIVE tabs (for example, there isnt a Trainers page anymore since it will be part of the tutorials guide page).

## Mobile Nav Bar
Complete and total overhaul of the previous navigation bar. Now with far cleaner code and less JS. Occupies the whole screen, stops user from scrolling inside navbar and has a far cleaner design that syncs with the rest of the splats and the ""reforged"" aesthetic.

Alot of testing done on it with the inspector/dev tools of Chrome. But further testing is needed on an actual mobile device, just to make sure the font size and responsiveness is truly adequate.

## Footer
Also received a small redesign while keeping the same core structure. Now it has a much cleaner design. Updated a couple of links and terminology as well.

# Leaderboards
## Responsiveness
The leaderboard had issues with the names of usernames having the "" - "" character (as seen with user  ""e------------"") since it would break off into the next line when the username ran out of space rather than hide the overflow (increasing the height of the username column, making it not able to fit correctly with the other columns). The issue wasn't resolved directly, but instead the username column had an increase of space (at the expense of the rating column being smaller now).

Also received minor changes with the placement of the buttons for ease of use.

## Other
Smaller and trivial changes were done to certain variables or pages. Nothing worth mentioning (such as slight color changes on _variables.sass).

* Landing page (#395)

* Fix Development Environment Issues

## Fix
We commented out localization support for the time being and fixed other issues in other files due to missing package variables (such as let = require('moment').

* Landing Page 2.0

## Landing Page

the landing page has received some well deserved updates. A lot of content was recycled and given much more cleaner and smoother designs (while using much more compact and less clunky code).

## h1, h2, p

Now the website is featuring a stronger usage of h1, h2 and p for title, subtitle and paragraph. This will allow for a better standardization across the room and using less codes since .somethingTitle or .somethingSubtitle won't be used anymore.

## Image Purge

with the new update to the landing page, a lot of old and unused images have been purged. Creating a cleaner image folder.

## Variables and Mixins

Some Mixins (such as buttons) received a well deserved update as well.

A tricolor (regular, light and dark) faction color variables have been created in case something needs to be faction color coded.

* Adding the GOG link pages

* Client News Update

## New Features
Besides now having a much cleaner and smoother design that fits better with FAF, the new newshub comes with a couple more features.

### Image Sizing
Now all image sizes are supported! No need to make your images 145x97 or other cumbersome sizes. Now images are automatically re-sized.

 Images with a 16:9 ratio (2560x1440, 1920x1080, 1280x720 or anything ""rectangular"") will fit perfectly. Other non-rectangular images will still adjust correctly but might receive a cut-off.

 ### Unlimited Articles
 Since now the articles are on a ""slider"", we dont have a limit with how many articles we can have without sacrificing design. So 5, 7 or 12 articles will all display equally well!

 ### Responsiveness
 This design has media queries and responsive unit sizes (such as vw) to always adjust to the users preferences. Therefore, the news will display adequately whether it's on a full screen window or 1/4 of the monitor screen.

 ### More Information Less Clutter
 The new design also provides more links for the user. With joining the discord, twitch and youtube FAF content being one click away plus new sections for new players, community tools/spaces and developmet plus a Support FAF button and a Report a Bug button all in one compact and clean design!

 ## Other
 Many of the images inside the images folder have been moved to a logos folder in order to maintain a better order inside the folder (rather than having 40 images on one folder, have them on their own folders).

* Fixing Links of Client-News

Tiny commit to fix the links and a bit of wording on the client-news.

* TOS Pages

- All the TOS pages have been converted over to Pug files
- English TOS page is the Default Page with a link to translated versions at the bottom of the page

* Minor Fixes To Client News

The client-news page has stayed mostly the same but received some minor styling changes that make the design more compact, takes away highlight/focus from minor parts and makes titles stand out more.

* Fixing News Links

Just re-adding the correct links to the client news.

* FAF Teams

## Page Creation
The FAF Teams has been updated. Now featuring a slicker design that elegantly incorporates the new background.

The page now has 9 teams out of 11. Community Manager seemed more like a one person position and it seems the Game team will be disolved. Ergo, they were not added so we could have a perfect 3x3 grid for Teams.

The teams also now feature a bigger description made by me using what was found in the teams page in the FAF wiki.

* Donations Page

## Page Creation
The Donation has been updated. Now featuring a slicker design that elegantly incorporates the new background.

The page now has a pie chart to demonstrate how FAF expenses are being done and two buttons for Patreon and Paypal.

* Contributions Page

## Page Creation
The Contributions page has been updated.

# PUG
## index.pug

The multiple and slide variants/containers were taken out and replaced by the improvement container. The latter is cleaner and easier to read, and takes less user imput for the same output.

The rectangle containers were improved so they take less space and look somewhat cleaner.

Other unused classes/code was cleaned for better readability.
## default.pug
a link was added to the FAF logo on the footer, favicon image was also added.

# SASS
## _navigation.sass

Font sizes were all decreased so the website is easier to read and less on the ""face"" of the user.

FAF logo on the footer is now aligned with the other footer elements.

## index.sass
Creation of the styling of the improvement container, made the thinContainer titles have a z-index so the splat doesn't overlap them. Made other images and items smaller for better readability.

# Images
Some images were changed/updated to have a correct size ration for the rectangle container (from 1:1 to 16:9).

* Navigation Page Update (#349)

# PUG
## index.pug
Fixed small bug with thin container being overlapped by splat img.
## default.pug
Added FAF logo to mobile navbar.

# SASS
## _navigation.sass

Mobile navbar received some styling updates, icons and text got more padding for less mistakes in smartphone touch. Created styling for the FAF logo on mobile navbar.

## index.sass
Improved improvement container so its responsive to screen size (making itself 3, 2 or 1 columns depending on how big the screen is).

# Images
New faction and resource pattern images added for mobile navbar

* $Variables (#351)

# PUG
### ai.pug
Made the rectangle containers more compact (again, less on the ""face"" of the reader).

### default.pug
Made a comment in a nav_absolute that seems misplaced but isn't.

# SASS
### _navigation.sass and index.sass

Starting to update most of the css variable var(--) for the better $variable used by sass. This is being done so @Mixins can be used soon.

### mixins.sass
Cleared out of unused Mixins and updated to become the current variable.sass. It doesn't have any mixins but depending on the amount of mixins used, I might just not make a different page for variables and one for mixins (less pages = better).

### _mixins.sass and _footer.sass
Both deleted as they are out of use.

# JS
### index.js
Made extra comments so JS is even clearer and updated the pulsating function to work without var(--) (JS can't use $color because it will render $color into the css rather than the actual color variable. Ergo, manual colors were used).

#Images
### footerbanner.jpg
Updated to a better version of it that will be better displayed on smaller screens.

* Preparing for Localisation Support (#352)

- Adds the Following to package.json : i18next,i18next-browser-languagedetector, i18next-fs-backend, i18next-http-middleware
- Updates yarn.lock
- Added Initialisation to express.js of i18n Support
- Added locales' folder structure
- Added translation.json files to locales folders

* Minor fixes & Add new Pages (#353)

- index.pug removed # calls with . notation
- index.sass removed # calls with . notation
- Added patchnotes.js & patchnotes.pug & updated express.js Accordingly

* The fix for the fix (#354)

# PUG and SASS
### index.pug #index.sass
Just re-adding some # that were necessary for IDs in the JS

* @use mixins (#356)

* #@use and mixins

## PUG and SASS
### index.pug #index.sass
Added mixins.$variables (the correct way, rather than just $variable).

Renamed the split containers to grid. Grid is a much more fitting name than split for the ""template"" of the grid containers.

## _mixins.sass
Received some new mixins.

## _navigation.sass
Deleted alot of unnecessary 0px (px not needed) to clean up the Problems tab and rid the code of every ""problem"" it had.

## site.sass and deletion
_mobile.sass, _fonts.sass and _elements.sass were deleted due to not being used and to clear space.

site.sass now uses (once more) @use rather than @import. This is due to the fact that @import is being deprecated this year and replaced by @use.

Code was improved with SASS and older code was deleted/changed to use less lines for the same output.

ACU container received a well deserving update

##JS

cleaned up old JS of ACU container but currently it doesn't work perfectly. Whoever wants to fix it can get a cookie lol.

* Update README.md (#358)

- Added Public POEditor link for site translation

* Language Tab + JS Fix (#359)

##PUG and SASS
### Navigation (default.pug, _navigation.sass)

A language tab has been added since Rowey is working on adding multi-language capabilities to the website.

##JS
### index.js
The faction containers got fixed and now work plus they have new hover and active animations.

* Re-structuring + Cleanup (#360)

## Deletion
Files deleted were 99% related to the styling of the website. Due to the new development of the website, these style sheets don't work anymore unless I stick to the naming conventions and previous work done. However, a great part of these files either seem to bear no purpose or are inefficient (such as using static sizes for the size or width of elements, making them non-responsive to changes in screen size).

## JS
### index.js
Gave the language navigation it's own JS, trying to make it respond to click rather than hover but its a work in progress.

## PUG
### index.pug
Added comments for clarity
### newshub.pug
Starting to toy around with it, trying to understand the logic and way it was structured so we can update the newshub. I would just re-do it from start but the code being used from wordpress and the json is far too advanced for us to re-do at the moment.

### ai.pug
Making the contents more compact so they are easier to read

### tutorials-guides.pug
Creation of page, work in progress.

## JS
### index.js
The faction containers got fixed and now work plus they have new hover and active animations.

## SASS
Small changes done to the styling of the pages, changed margins and fixed other issues.

* Update README.md (#361)

- Replaced Image with new Frontend

* Banners and Pages (#362)

## PUG
### default.pug
Through a mixin banner and the use of blocks, now I have created a template for all the banners that is very easy to configure across the board. You will see almost all pug pages now have their own banner with images and text.

The navbar has also become a bit smaller and Kazbek's statistics removed from it.
### index.pug
Small changes and the removal of Kazbek's player statistics from the FAF Improvements section.

## SASS
### Overall
Small styling changes, made the rectangle container a mixin so it can be added in multiple places yet changed on each page.

### _variables.sass
Despite it containing unused content. This styling sheet now contains the current used variables. Therefore, _mixins.sass currently only has mixins and not both mixins and variables

## Images
Images have been added/updated for the new banners every page has.

## Deletion
Jquery was deleted since it wasn't being used.

* Banners and Pages (#363)

## Content Creator Page
This update is just the creation of the content needed for the content creator page, it using a pug mixin and being pretty much ""completed"" for now.
## default.pug
The navbar received some re-ordering so it is ordered by longest to shortest text, giving it a cleaner look.

## Elsewhere
Not much was changed, maybe I created the sass files needed for certain pages but nothing significant was done.

* FAF TEAMS (#364)

## FAF TEAMS
This update is just the creation of the content needed for the faf teams page, it using a pug mixin and being pretty much ""completed"" for now.

* Leaderboard (WIP) (made with @MrRowey) (#375)

## Leaderboard
Current work to ""recreate"" the leaderboards.

* Game Server Player Counter (#378)

Added back in the player counter to the main page

* Fixed default.pug not working (#380)

## default.pug
Small fix to default.pug so @MrRowey can continue to work on the player counter.

## index.pug
JS was on the same indentation as a block content and so it wasnt working. I indented so it works.

## PUG
index.pug and default.pug both received updates so only the index page shows the amount of players currently online.

leaderboards.pug received some IDs in order to be able to receive the js from leaderboards.js adequately.

## JS
leaderboards.js received the JS needed to be able to pull the data from 1v1.json and make the leaderboard for 1v1. Currently, it only supports the first 100 players, soon a First, last, previous and next buttons will be added.

## Other scripts
Certain changes that were very minor were done on extractor.js, getRecentUsers.js and so on were done so the files from the API are placed in the correct folder.

## PUG
Small changes to naming and the addition of certain IDs in certain elements for their use in js (for example, the global container having a #globalLeaderboard Id so it can be called in js when its clicked)

## JS
### Creation of the Pagination
The complete creation of the next, previous and switch of leaderboard type (currently only global). This was done through just removing the previous contents with the'delete' class and re-adding the new ones which then would be changed either to the next 100 players or the previous 100. Huge thanks to both @MrRowey and @Sheikah

## Other scripts
Small change done to updateLeagues.js so it moves the clans.json to the correct members folder and also adding a .gitignore to it so the json files dont get commited.

## Styling

This update brings a lot of styling changes to the leaderboards and small tweaks to the size of the nav bar and other things.

## Functionality
Now all 4 leaderboards are operational with their own searchbar that can compare across the board. It is still a work in progress to get the missing player issue working.

## Bigger Reason
This commit is being done since my PC is having issues and I want to keep a safe copy of my work before its too late.

* Leaderboards Completed

## SASS Changes
Deletion of unused classes, cleanup of leaderboards styling, the adding of other classes that were needed for the new dropdown buttons.

## JS Changes
The leaderboard finally is fully operational. With a time filter, search function, matchmaker filter and a clean UI that works both in desktop and mobile screen sizes.

Alot of the previous JS was trimmed and made much more compact, so the leaderboards.js are occupying as least space as needed and now can be read much more easily.

## PUG

Small changes done to certain naming classes and Ids for a cleaner and easier to read file.

* Leaderboards and Extractor

## JS
Improvements made to the extractor.js file, made far more compact and using less packages and way less code repetition.

leaderboards.js also had improvements thanks to @Louvenarde's review on how to do certain processes on a more efficient manner (such as using flooring instead of slicing to get the last page of the leaderboards). Also updated to reflect the new changes done on extractor.js.

## Node-fetch
installed so we could use fetch to call API.

## AI Page
Deletion of the LOUD honorable mention due to the association's decision on the annual meeting.

* Fix Development Environment Issues (#392)

## Fix
We commented out localization support for the time being and fixed other issues in other files due to missing package variables (such as let = require('moment').

* Navbar old (#393)

* Fix Development Environment Issues

## Fix

* Navigation Bar 2.0
# Navigation
## Desktop Navbar
Received some minor updates, having the same core structure but a new fade animation added to its menus. Now both the topnavbar and the desktop navbar share the same color for a more unified structure.

The PLAY NOW button was reduced to a DOWNLOAD button.

FAF NEWS > NEWS

and the removal of other elements inside the GAME, COMMUNITY And COMPETITIVE tabs (for example, there isnt a Trainers page anymore since it will be part of the tutorials guide page).

## Mobile Nav Bar
Complete and total overhaul of the previous navigation bar. Now with far cleaner code and less JS. Occupies the whole screen, stops user from scrolling inside navbar and has a far cleaner design that syncs with the rest of the splats and the ""reforged"" aesthetic.

Alot of testing done on it with the inspector/dev tools of Chrome. But further testing is needed on an actual mobile device, just to make sure the font size and responsiveness is truly adequate.

## Footer
Also received a small redesign while keeping the same core structure. Now it has a much cleaner design. Updated a couple of links and terminology as well.

# Leaderboards
## Responsiveness
The leaderboard had issues with the names of usernames having the "" - "" character (as seen with user  ""e------------"") since it would break off into the next line when the username ran out of space rather than hide the overflow (increasing the height of the username column, making it not able to fit correctly with the other columns). The issue wasn't resolved directly, but instead the username column had an increase of space (at the expense of the rating column being smaller now).

Also received minor changes with the placement of the buttons for ease of use.

## Other
Smaller and trivial changes were done to certain variables or pages. Nothing worth mentioning (such as slight color changes on _variables.sass).

* Landing page (#395)

* Fix Development Environment Issues

## Fix
We commented out localization support for the time being and fixed other issues in other files due to missing package variables (such as let = require('moment').

* Landing Page 2.0

## Landing Page

the landing page has received some well deserved updates. A lot of content was recycled and given much more cleaner and smoother designs (while using much more compact and less clunky code).

## h1, h2, p

Now the website is featuring a stronger usage of h1, h2 and p for title, subtitle and paragraph. This will allow for a better standardization across the room and using less codes since .somethingTitle or .somethingSubtitle won't be used anymore.

## Image Purge

with the new update to the landing page, a lot of old and unused images have been purged. Creating a cleaner image folder.

## Variables and Mixins

Some Mixins (such as buttons) received a well deserved update as well.

A tricolor (regular, light and dark) faction color variables have been created in case something needs to be faction color coded.

* Removed Commented Code & Account pages Forming (#396)

## challonge_connect.js
add new js file for the updated chalonge api fucnion which it TODO

* Adding the GOG link pages

* Client News Update

## New Features
Besides now having a much cleaner and smoother design that fits better with FAF, the new newshub comes with a couple more features.

### Image Sizing
Now all image sizes are supported! No need to make your images 145x97 or other cumbersome sizes. Now images are automatically re-sized.

 Images with a 16:9 ratio (2560x1440, 1920x1080, 1280x720 or anything ""rectangular"") will fit perfectly. Other non-rectangular images will still adjust correctly but might receive a cut-off.

 ### Unlimited Articles
 Since now the articles are on a ""slider"", we dont have a limit with how many articles we can have without sacrificing design. So 5, 7 or 12 articles will all display equally well!

 ### Responsiveness
 This design has media queries and responsive unit sizes (such as vw) to always adjust to the users preferences. Therefore, the news will display adequately whether it's on a full screen window or 1/4 of the monitor screen.

 ### More Information Less Clutter
 The new design also provides more links for the user. With joining the discord, twitch and youtube FAF content being one click away plus new sections for new players, community tools/spaces and developmet plus a Support FAF button and a Report a Bug button all in one compact and clean design!

 ## Other
 Many of the images inside the images folder have been moved to a logos folder in order to maintain a better order inside the folder (rather than having 40 images on one folder, have them on their own folders).

* Fixing Links of Client-News

Tiny commit to fix the links and a bit of wording on the client-news.

* TOS Pages

- All the TOS pages have been converted over to Pug files
- English TOS page is the Default Page with a link to translated versions at the bottom of the page

* Minor Fixes To Client News

The client-news page has stayed mostly the same but received some minor styling changes that make the design more compact, takes away highlight/focus from minor parts and makes titles stand out more.

* Fixing News Links

Just re-adding the correct links to the client news.

* FAF Teams

## Page Creation
The FAF Teams has been updated. Now featuring a slicker design that elegantly incorporates the new background.

The page now has 9 teams out of 11. Community Manager seemed more like a one person position and it seems the Game team will be disolved. Ergo, they were not added so we could have a perfect 3x3 grid for Teams.

The teams also now feature a bigger description made by me using what was found in the teams page in the FAF wiki.

* Donations Page

## Page Creation
The Donation has been updated. Now featuring a slicker design that elegantly incorporates the new background.

The page now has a pie chart to demonstrate how FAF expenses are being done and two buttons for Patreon and Paypal.

* Contributions Page

## Page Creation
The Contributions page has been updated.

hyde/hyde;cd9b1891c09e858e7e4db0c87267014b81be7adf;"Add a CleverCSS plugin.

CleverCSS [1] is a Python-based preprocessor for CSS. It is not quite
as powerful as LessCSS and doesn't seem to get much updates, but the
advantage is that it only requires Python (which you'd already have for
Hyde) and you don't need node.js or some client-side JS.

hyde/hyde;c8e2caaa4d0a434d158b80b33f9ef5701b587957;"[WIP] Add Sphinx docs

This is the starting point of documenting Hyde using Sphinx. This
provides several benefits:

1. Code and documentation live together, so it's easier to track and
enforce that there exists documentation for new or changing code.

2. This lets us get Hyde on Read The Docs.

3. We can use things like `autoclass` where appropriate to pull
documentation directly from source code without reinventing the wheel.

I've tried to replicate what currently exists on hyde.github.io. The
first pass of this effort is concerned with parity, and we can continue
to improve from there on. Steps:

1. Convert all existing documentation on hyde.github.io to Sphinx. This
is covered by this commit and should be considered ""in review"".

2. Open issues for core parts of Hyde that are missing documentation.

3. Close these issues individually. This is a great opportunity for
community members wishing to get involved to contribute.

4. Require significant changes in code to be accompanied by updated /
new documentation the same way we would require tests.

While these steps are in progress, the following should also be done:

1. Deprecate the docs at hyde.github.io, linking users to Read The Docs.

2. Replace the content currently hosted at hyde.github.io with a new
brochure site showing off some of Hyde's uses and linking to other
interesting content (e.g. a list of themes, links to sites powered by
Hyde, etc.).

References #188, #209, and quite a few other issues.

@lakshmivyas, @llonchj: please review. This is a starting point for
Sphinx docs, and the PR is labelled as a work in progress, but I have no
specific threshold for it being ""done"". Once we're all satisfied with
the first pass, I'll set up RTD, and we can start filing issues for
specific areas lacking docs.";0

When editing a host configuration, enabling kdump support within
power management settings, the engine starts emitting errors like:
`Kdump integration is enabled for host 'XYZ', but kdump is not
configured properly on host`.
In order to complete this configuration step it is required to issue a
host reinstallation command.

I carefully confirmed this solution in the official Powershell documentation. My alias has been working in Windows Terminal Powershell terminal, and in VSCode Powershell terminal, and after system shutdown, and in multiple windows and tabs.

* Use Debian bullseye, not buster in React tutorial

Debian bullseye is the current stable Debian release.

Use stable rather than oldstable.

* Use docker-workflow:1.27 in tutorial, not 1.26

No reason to use older version in the tutorial

* Publish port 3000 on Windows and Linux tutorial

Was only published in the annotated Linux segment, not in the
annotation-free Linux section or in the Windows section.

* Reduce differences between tutorial and installing

Tutorial needs the home directory mapped for all the tutorials and
needs port 3000 published for the ReactJS demo application.

* Use bat line continuation, not powershell

Batch line continuation is more common and is widely used throughout the
other tutorials.

* Use Jenkins version in sample docker image tag

Easier to diagnose as a tutorial developer and guides the user to
create tags that do not abandon the meaning of a release number.

The overall image compression is around 44.5%, sparing us 36.86 MB in

as an interim step. LinkedIn links had to be verified manually due to
robots.txt, all the old numeric links now fail. There's a bunch of
2013/2014 era stuff that no longer worked either. Finally a few
owasp.org things now fail after the site migration.

In the majority of cases I just removed the broken reference (I don't
have time of energy to go hunting for people.)

* Revert ""Setup new layout for individual API pages""

This reverts commit 23d00e5b5cf681d474efe21f73a0c6666c5ff953.

These updates are not ready to launch yet - revert them so they’re not part of the PR for bidder updates

* Add helper script to find ungrouped bidders

Whenever bidders are added to the site they need to be assigned to a `list_group` from `dev-docs/bidders.md` via the individual bidder frontmatter. If a bidder isn’t assigned to a `list_group` then they won’t appear on the Bidders page.

This script checks all bidders and lists those that aren’t assigned to a `list_group`.

Exclude the script so it’s not included in the generated site.

* Assign new bidders to list groups

* Revert ""Update CNAME for testing""

Restore expected CNAME for production site.

This reverts commit 0c0166c148ed7640452944a4e6bc53ecdfc552a4.

A) to route platform internal traffic of the
platform
B) To ensure internal OOF are not delivered to other platform tenants


The WSP Exchange SP2 Transport Agent is responsible for the following:
A) Determine that an email is being sent between tenants on the same system,
and re-routes the mail to deliver to a smart host elsewhere in the network, for
 subsequent routing back to Exchange.
B) Since Exchange Server 2007, a user has been able to set both an internal and
 an external OOF, and have Exchange deliver the OOF based on the sender being
 inside or outside the same Exchange Organization. In a multi-tenant
 configuration of Exchange such as that described in this document, all users
 in all tenants are considered internal to each other, and so the Internal OOF
 is sent between them if emails are exchange and OOF is set on a mailbox.
 The transport agent will prohibit to exchange internal OOF between different tenants
The transport agent will override the recipient destination for inter tenant
email exchange to an alternative domain. The platform will have a send
connector defined pointing assigned to the alternative domain name space and
pointing to the next hop, a smart hosts (This can be a Windows SMTP Service).
The smarthost will have a smarthost defined as well that will route back
the message to the platform.
Perform the following steps:
A)	Copy the files WSPTransportAgent.dll and WSPTransportAgent.dll.config
to ?C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V14\Public?
B)	Import the WSPTransportAgent.reg to create the event source
C)	Use the registry editor and provide the? NETWORK SERVICE? Full Control
on the following Key
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\eventlog\WSPTransportAgent
D	Run the following powershell command in the exchange management shell:
	Install-TransportAgent ?WSPTransportAgent? ?TransportAgentFactory
        WSPTransportAgent.MEACPRoutingAgentFactory
        ?AssemblyPath
 ?C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V14\Public\WSPTransportAgent.dll?
D)	Enable-TransportAgent ?WSPTransportAgent?
E)	Restart the Microsoft Exchange Transport Service
The configuration file contains the following configurable items:
Key	Value
A) routingDomain	This is the alternative domain that will be added to
the recipient domain name. This should be aligned with the namespace for the
send connector. A sample value could be ?.tmp?. The send connector will in
that case serve the  *.tmp namespace
logFile	Full qualified path to log file that will be used when verbose logging
is enabled (e.g. c:\temp\WSP.log)
enableVerboseLogging	Possible values: true or false. Enables or disables
verbose logging. This should be disabled by default
blockInternalInterTenantOOF	Possible values: true or false.
Enabled the internal auto reply between tenants. Auto replies within the
tenant or with external tenants (not hosted on the platform) will receive the
internal or external auto reply message.

* Add Deck Windows installation instructions

Summary

Add Deck Windows installation instructions using CMD.

As of [Windows 10 Build 17063] (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/community/team-blog/2017/20171219-tar-and-curl-come-to-windows) tar and curl are now packaged by default in the OS.

Used PowerShell to add to environment path since SETX has a 1024 characters limit and could truncate the values.

* Apply suggestions from code review

Co-authored-by: Gabriele <gabrielegerbino@gmail.com>

* remove conditional formatting

* Update src/deck/installation.md
