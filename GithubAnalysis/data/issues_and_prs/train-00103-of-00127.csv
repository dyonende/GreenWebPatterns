username_0: **This is a Bug Report**

<!--Required Information-->
**Problem:**
`local` is not given as a type of Persistent Volume:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#types-of-persistent-volumes

but the example for `local` Volume is a PV:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add `local` to types of PV
- Modify Volume example to not be a PV: PV page suggests 'familiarity with volumes', but one of the simplest volume types to understand has a PV example

**Page to Update:**
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes

Just commenting in case you have the power to add some magic `no-go-stale` label or something, I'll probably mute notifications now since they're just noise from my perspective (and I'm _trying_ to keep a better grip on notifications :slightly_smiling_face:).

I've read through the updated descriptions and think they are really good 👍 

After reading through these while trying to put my self in the shoes of someone knew to development and Odin. I think we should take a slightly different approach to this though. I think theres 2 things we want to communicate with the descriptions.

2. I think we should emphasise what the user will be able to do by the time they complete each course.

So with these in mind what about descriptions like these?

Web Development 101
""To start things off, in this course you will get a quick hands-on overview for all the different parts of full stack development you'll use to build fully functioning web apps.""

Ruby Programming
""Now that you've got a got overview of how all the different pieces of web development fit together. Its time to deep dive into learning programming using Ruby, a versitile, powerful and beginner friendly language designed for programmer happiness.""

We need to discuss that in the next design review though.

I think focusing on the brief descriptions is best for this ticket. 

Some sort of combination of the flow and what the student will be capable of when they complete each course is how I envisioned these descriptions.

This is the way I approached it
Imagining you're a new user to the site, as a new user you'll probably be exploring to see if the curriculum is for you are not. From that point of view you'll want to know how each part of the curriculum fits together and even more importantly what you will expect to be able to do by the end of the curriculum.

Maybe this is the wrong way to think about it, I personally think the descriptions have more benefit to new users than existing users. As existing users will already have a good idea of whats in the curriculum.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 Got it.

With focusing on just the brief descriptions, can you give me a ballpark character count? How short is too short? How long is too long? This will help me make a block of text that fits well with the rest of the layout.
<issue_comment>username_1: I think limiting it to about 3 lines would be ideal 😄 that will lower the resistance of users to read them and look better on mobile.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 Cool. ~225 characters looks like this.

Is that what you envision?
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks all for the feedback. Updated descriptions based on feedback from @username_1. I think JavaScript is still not exactly where it needs to be, but I hope we're close. Here are what they look like in the current design:

username_0: ## About

Kubernetes is a complex product and we would like to be able to better explain its core concepts through use of visuals. A visual language composed of symbols and icons will enable the creation of illustrative diagrams.
## Current State

Only symbols we have today are in the first five slides of this [Google Cloud Platform slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13klSkUQI9yPxKckP8UFLpzzKzxYwv1lit9ELWOnXJFM/edit#slide=id.p15) (if anyone has any others please share). 
## Proposal
1. **Prioritize concepts** we want to have visualizations for. 
2. **Discuss possible representations for concepts & post sketches**. Loop in Google UX researchers for feedback.
3. **Establish basic visual guidelines** for designs of different icons to adhere to as we expand the library. Symbols should be grounded in [Material Design System Icons](https://material.google.com/style/icons.html#icons-system-icons) principles (e.g. ""Bold, geometric, simple, intuitive, actionable, consistent""). The Slides of the [Google Cloud Platform visual language](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13klSkUQI9yPxKckP8UFLpzzKzxYwv1lit9ELWOnXJFM/edit#slide=id.p15) should be referenced as inspiration, but we're also not going out of our way to align with this style.
4. **Design visually consistent vector (i.e. SVG) symbols**.

Based on @bgrant0607's [proposed concepts](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/issues/84#issuecomment-226300701), I've put together the following list of concepts to consider for visualization:
- Pod
- All types of services:
  - Cluster
  - Nodeport
  - Loadbalancer
  - Headless
  - Imported
- Ingress
- EndPoint
- Every controller:
  - Replication Controller
  - Replica Set
  - Deployment
  - DaemonSet
  - PetSet
  - Job
  - ScheduledJob
- Rolling update
- Canary deployment pattern
  - with ConfigMap
- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling
- ServiceAccount
- Secret
- Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims
- System Architecture
- Things we will need to diagram concepts and processes
  - Virtual IP
  - IP address
  - Running Container
  - Request / Response

As @pwittrock [pointed out](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.github.io/issues/84#issuecomment-228387857), we should focus first on designing visualizations for concepts, while keeping in mind how those visualizations will come together in more complex diagrams (e.g. _deployment_)

username_0: Fixes #17174 

""compute"" is a verb, the most likely typo here is the author meant to write ""computers"".
<issue_comment>username_1: “compute” is jargon, meaning “the abstract concept of performing computation”. That's analogous to how the existing text has “storage” rather than “storage devices”.

Although “compute” is jargon, replacing it with “computers” doesn't feel right either: it changes the meaning. For examples of the jargon in common use, see https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/ and [https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute).

@username_0 can you suggest an alternative rewording that leaves the meaning and nuance intact?
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 I see your point, but I believe that probably stems that ""storage"" is much more colloquial in technical jargon than ""compute"". Compute here reads awkwardly because used without some kind of qualifier it reads foremost as a verb. In your examples, the real jargon phrase would probably be ""edge compute"" and ""compute time"" rather than just ""compute"" alone. The qualifiers of time and edge add context to the word compute, giving it meaning. 

In light of that, I'd then suggest adding some kind of qualifier to compute to make it clear that it is jargon rather than the verb. Brainstorming a couple of possibilities below:
```
compute resources
compute power (computing?)
compute problems
compute concepts
compute issues
```
<issue_comment>username_2: So it is very common in cloud computing for compute to be used as a noun.  See
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/6580/compute

That being said, if you prefer changing compute to either ""compute nodes""  or ""compute instances"" 
I would find both of those options as acceptable changes that improve readability.  Computers is definitely not the proper change here.
