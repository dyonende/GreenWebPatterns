username_0: This PR adds support for opening Hugo menu items in a new tab/window.

I've seen old Issues and Discourse posts on new tab support in Hugo but they all references opening links in content/Markdown. Hugo now has a config option to tell BlackFriday to do that and it works great. This PR is specifically for Hugo menus and allowing links to open in a new tab.

Many power users who surf the web know how to middle click a link to open in a new tab or to use the content menu or even control click. Not all users are power users. I've come across many website owners who don't want to lose visitors to certain external links, thus this feature comes in handy.

Also included is a small docs tweak to also mention this new menu item property.

I tried to follow [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/spf13/hugo/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to the tee here though I'm not sure what would be the best way to modify the tests file to include this property.

The Windows installation instructions found at https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html#x64_win-jdk contains information to use `unzip` to extract the downloaded archive.
Unfortunately, a standard installation of Windows does not contain the `unzip` tool, either need to go through PowerShell (`Expand-Archive`), Windows Explorer or a 3rd party option.

<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 Hadn't noticed myself that something had been done here.
But step 3 right now is a bit misleading, since the command is a powershell command and the intro text says "" use Terminal/Command Prompt "".

But I don't really know how many people are using these instructions anyway; I guess most people choosing to download the .zip file instead of the installer knows how to extract a .zip file.

username_0: Would you be open to updating the 'user showcase' with more well-known companies.

The current list:

- MHE Labs => Never heard of
- Yapp => Never heard of
- Tilde => We're a Skylight customer so I know, but it's not a well-known company
- Bustle => Never heard of

Instead, I'd suggest these four:

- **Netflix** (well known consumer company)
- **Intercom** (example of how powerful Ember is for large SPAs)
- **Zendesk** (good enterprise example)
- **Heroku** (have solid reputation among developers)

A few other good examples (but I'd still prefer the four above):
- Kickstarter
- LinkedIn
- Travis CI
- Square
<issue_comment>username_1: I think a general discussion of keeping the users and advertising up to date is something we should do better at.

However, the thought of highlighting some companies over others is short sighted IMO.

I think a big benefit of having a lot of different types of companies is that it shows Ember can be used in different situations.

In terms of companies to include I think there is a discussion of who we would like to contact, but there is legal and marketing hoops to go through in order to get approval to use company assets to market ember.
<issue_comment>username_2: I think it depends on what you know. From the list, my most well known are (in order):
Twitch, Acorns, NetFlix, Microsoft, TED, LinkedIN, testdouble, Travis CI, Yahoo, thoughtbot, Boxee,  Urbanspoon, Discourse, Square, ZenDesk, TinderBox,
<issue_comment>username_3: From what I remember, we've discussed this before.  I know we're potentially playing with 🔥 here (and so think we should tread cautiously), but I think there is merit in the discussion.

Most scrappy startups have a ""look who else is using us!"" section (like we currently do on the website) but they deliberately cherry-pick well-known brands if at all possible.  Neither the React nor the Angular website do this, but that's because React and Angular are well-known as tools with mammoth companies behind them.  One of Ember's main pitches is that we've adopted a ""coalition-led"" approach to OSS.  Given that, I think it's worth thinking through how to highlight well that that coalition approach has worked (and is still working) for us.

Politically, I can see this getting complicated.  But I still would like to see us consider how to improve it so that Ember isn't considered an also-ran in the JS world ... 😀
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 All companies I mentioned are either in the 'top four' front page list or among the [list of ember users](https://emberjs.com/ember-users/). So it's only a matter of prioritization — no need to ask any legal/marketing departments.

@username_2 Agree, it depends (I'm not American, for example). I'm not very fixed on a specific set of companies, as long choose good examples.

I'd say a balance between recognizable, different industries and different types of applications. So some consumer application, something B2B and tilted towards companies that developers will know about (sorry Bustle!, hehe).<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_4: Heya—

I'm on board for a refresh, it's time. I used to do it periodically but haven't in a while. So thanks @username_0 for bringing it back up!

We did some tidy-work on #3011, and talked about design changes in #2973. I'm still on board for the changes we theorized in #2973 but I don't think we have design resources to work on it. Also, there's no reason this should gate on that, but I wanted to make sure all the context was here :)

I'll get a new PR in today to at least make some starter swaps for bigger names. But I'd love to have someone tackle a design like #2973 if someone's up for it, and am still game to get in touch with the companies for authorization if the design materializes."
