<issue_comment>username_1: The important issue is this line:

`Error: File not found with singular glob: /home/mfoltyn/Projects/elementary/website/_images/icons/mimes/24/payment-card-amex.svg (if this was purposeful, use 'allowEmpty' option)`

This is because [`gulpfile.babel.js` Line 100](https://github.com/elementary/website/blob/master/gulpfile.babel.js#L100) explicitly lists what icons to build in the submodule. If that submodule falls out of sync, then the build fails.
<issue_comment>username_0: Shouldnt submodules be copied over when I clone the main repo? I dont recall needing to download / upadtes submodules separately. I dont use them.<issue_closed>

<issue_comment>username_1: Have you made sure to `git pull` and `npm install` again? This is interestings because `npm run build` works fine on master [right now](https://travis-ci.com/elementary/website/jobs/246425524#L677).
<issue_comment>username_0: That's interesting indeed. Yes I created new fork and cloned that one, so I am pretty sure I have latest version as of right now.
<issue_comment>username_0: What is your Node.js version? Maybe I am getting some npm package with different version.
<issue_comment>username_0: Hmm, I see that Travis job is running with Node 12.12.0 will try that.
<issue_comment>username_0: I updated both Node.js and npm, and tried again, on both Windows and Ubuntu. Ubuntu works fine (just like in Travis) but Windows has some sort of pathing issue. See [powershell output](https://i.imgur.com/tciBqTl.png). Will investigate.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 Seems like a multifaceted problem.

1) 'svg' task here: https://github.com/elementary/website/blob/7cf2d971060270eef506a1c892ce8f5658410253/gulpfile.babel.js#L100
fails on several whitelisted '_images/icons/<rest of path>' icons - all of the faulty ones are symlinks so it makes sense that it fails on windows, they are:
- '_images/icons/apps/symbolic/web-browser-symbolic.svg'
- '_images/icons/apps/32/accessories-camera.svg'
- '_images/icons/apps/48/ubiquity.svg'
- '_images/icons/apps/64/accessories-camera.svg'
- '_images/icons/apps/64/web-browser.svg'
- '_images/icons/devices/symbolic/computer-symbolic.svg'

To fix that I suppose it would be needed for them to actually have right contents.

2) 'scripts' tasks fails with some pathing error, wouldn't be suprised if it were something similar as above

Can we reopen the issue or is this a wontfix considering the problem only appears on Windows? Worst case scenario just add to readme ""If on Linux, use WSL"" - I have not tryed that yet though.
<issue_comment>username_2: We don't support building on systems other than Linux because there are a lot of inconsistencies with PHP and Node JS, especially with paths. We will accept PRs to make things work better on windows as long as it isn't _too_ extreme.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thank you for info.

Seems I will go the WSL / Ubuntu host OS way then. Is it OK if I make PR adding above comment to CONTRIBUTING.md ?"

Unfortunately, the k8s_processor is lacking documentation which includes RBAC rules. Once this is added, it would be easy enough to update the k8s example to leverage this processor.\r\n\r\nThere is a bigger question around core versus contrib docs -- for getting started, current thought process is that core should be the priority, Suggestions welcome here.\r\n\r\nRegarding vendor documentation -- I am familiar with the first two links :) what do you think is missing from the getting started documentation here?

I think it shows, and certainly makes the docs clearer. The docker addition in #380 along with the additional details around Linux packaging is definitely helpful.\r\n\r\nI do happen to think that a well documented k8s_processor will be quite necessary for most k8s use cases, so i\'m glad to hear that\'s being considered to be added to onboarding docs. Perhaps I am mistaken but afaik, in an ""otel-agent running as daemonset + otel-collector running as gateway service"" scenario, which is what the example k8s manifest shows, any sort of accurate correlation of traces or metrics with appropriate host would not be possible, unless the application sdk or service emitting the telemetry data to the otel-agents were adding that metadata. \r\n\r\nThat being said it\'s entirely possible I am mistaking the limitations/concerns/bias of my own employer with that of the community (that seems to be a common habit for folks these days 😅 ), and a k8s_processor is not nearly as important as I\'ve indicated. In which case, disregard!\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, while considering whether to focus on core vs contrib, I would encourage the docs to highlight relevant contrib components where applicable in the future. For example, highlighting the [docker stats receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver) for dockerized setups, and so on.\r\n\r\nLastly (hats off if you\'re still reading), regarding your followup Q, Two areas I think some vendor docs excel, especially LS, \r\n\r\n- they do a 1st class job of walking through the concepts with [visual aids](https://a.cl.ly/jkueEjEl), and in general I think they provide a clear explanation of some otherwise confusing topics. Their explanation of [context propagation](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/context-propagation/) is a good example of making few assumptions about what a user might already know about Tracing, starting broadly, and working toward specific implementation details for OpenTelemetry. I\'m not sure this type of bottoms up approach to key concepts exists as thoughtfully in the Otel docs.\r\n\r\n- They also do a good job of suggesting useful semantic conventions to use for things like resource attributes. Something like `service.version` and `service.name`, which are more or less ""key"" resource attributes, are [specified clearly in the LS docs](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/attributes-and-labels/) but not so much in the OpenTelemetry.io docs as far as I can tell. The [OTEL SDK Env vars](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/e26d61107e7309aee1e69bb37011043dd6fe6ebe/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md) would also be a nice thing to highlight since their use will be a much easier onboarding path than attempting to have users modify application code with, in some cases, potentially dynamic values. Lastly it\'s just sort\'ve like, if we went through all the trouble of bikeshedding for years over semantic conventions and attribute names and so on, we should totally promote their use now that there\'s some stability and consensus.\r\n\r\nAnyway @username_4 and @username_1 and friends, I hope that helps, I am totally fine if you want to close this issue, or if you\'d prefer to leave it open for further comment from the community. ty for coming to my ted talk.', 'title': None, 'type': 'comment'}

username_0: Hello friends,

I'd like to kindly ask about whether there are plans to update the Getting Started guides for docker and kubernetes on the current roadmap? At present, they leave a lot to be desired

- For example, Docker points to [a local repo instead of the appropriate image](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/blob/0333664c4e14d35c96c3ed72d37aa46bf38de7eb/content/en/docs/collector/getting-started.md#docker). 

- And, [the Kubernetes setup guide](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry.io/blob/0333664c4e14d35c96c3ed72d37aa46bf38de7eb/content/en/docs/collector/getting-started.md#kubernetes) points a k8s manifest which doesn't include any references to the k8s_processor, which is going to be required for the very large majority of OTEL users deploying the collector in a production otel environment.

While it's great to see so many contributors from so many Commercial Open Source Software vendors, it seems like most of the organisations involves have preferred to contribute to their own proprietary documentation that exists in their own repositories or on their forks of the opentelemetry collector, and these documentation improvements have not made it back upstream . Some examples, (not meant in a negative way, just showing off some strong documentation, diagrams, or explanations of key concepts which live outside the OTEL docs).

<issue_comment>username_2: My 2 cents as someone with a bit of experience in metrics and tracing: when I was trying to get started with OpenTelemetry in Go a couple of months back I found it very frustrating.

My recommendation would be to port this page to Otel: https://opentracing.io/docs/getting-started/
The similar page [here](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/go/getting-started/) has improved since I needed it, but the example dumps traces to stdout. That is not going to show newcomers the power of distributed tracing.
<issue_comment>username_3: consider referencing posts from @username_5 on the topic: https://medium.com/@jpkroehling
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_0 have a look at #380. The getting started documentation was ported directly from the core repository and the core repository had pre-existing examples. I went ahead and added the Docker Hub information especially since it comes with a default configuration now this really is easier than the example -- thanks for pointing this out!

Regarding k8s -- the examples are built on the core repository and the k8s_processor is in contrib. Unfortunately, the k8s_processor is lacking documentation which includes RBAC rules. Once this is added, it would be easy enough to update the k8s example to leverage this processor.

There is a bigger question around core versus contrib docs -- for getting started, current thought process is that core should be the priority, Suggestions welcome here.

Regarding vendor documentation -- I am familiar with the first two links :) what do you think is missing from the getting started documentation here? Fully agree with Austin that the goal should be to provide the best docs on this site.
<issue_comment>username_5: Feel free to use/reuse the blog posts as you see fit!
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_4 Sorry for the delayed response, I have been a little underwater. 

I appreciate all the work you've put in here. I think it shows, and certainly makes the docs clearer. The docker addition in #380 along with the additional details around Linux packaging is definitely helpful.

I do happen to think that a well documented k8s_processor will be quite necessary for most k8s use cases, so i'm glad to hear that's being considered to be added to onboarding docs. Perhaps I am mistaken but afaik, in an ""otel-agent running as daemonset + otel-collector running as gateway service"" scenario, which is what the example k8s manifest shows, any sort of accurate correlation of traces or metrics with appropriate host would not be possible, unless the application sdk or service emitting the telemetry data to the otel-agents were adding that metadata. 

That being said it's entirely possible I am mistaking the limitations/concerns/bias of my own employer with that of the community (that seems to be a common habit for folks these days 😅 ), and a k8s_processor is not nearly as important as I've indicated. In which case, disregard!

Broadly speaking, while considering whether to focus on core vs contrib, I would encourage the docs to highlight relevant contrib components where applicable in the future. For example, highlighting the [docker stats receiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/master/receiver/dockerstatsreceiver) for dockerized setups, and so on.

Lastly (hats off if you're still reading), regarding your followup Q, Two areas I think some vendor docs excel, especially LS, 

- they do a 1st class job of walking through the concepts with [visual aids](https://a.cl.ly/jkueEjEl), and in general I think they provide a clear explanation of some otherwise confusing topics. Their explanation of [context propagation](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/context-propagation/) is a good example of making few assumptions about what a user might already know about Tracing, starting broadly, and working toward specific implementation details for OpenTelemetry. I'm not sure this type of bottoms up approach to key concepts exists as thoughtfully in the Otel docs.

- They also do a good job of suggesting useful semantic conventions to use for things like resource attributes. Something like `service.version` and `service.name`, which are more or less ""key"" resource attributes, are [specified clearly in the LS docs](https://opentelemetry.lightstep.com/core-concepts/attributes-and-labels/) but not so much in the OpenTelemetry.io docs as far as I can tell. The [OTEL SDK Env vars](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/e26d61107e7309aee1e69bb37011043dd6fe6ebe/specification/sdk-environment-variables.md) would also be a nice thing to highlight since their use will be a much easier onboarding path than attempting to have users modify application code with, in some cases, potentially dynamic values. Lastly it's just sort've like, if we went through all the trouble of bikeshedding for years over semantic conventions and attribute names and so on, we should totally promote their use now that there's some stability and consensus.

Anyway @username_4 and @username_1 and friends, I hope that helps, I am totally fine if you want to close this issue, or if you'd prefer to leave it open for further comment from the community. ty for coming to my ted talk.
<issue_comment>username_1: I'm fine leaving it open for more discussion for now. If we can identify specific workable items (such as visual aids for concepts, context prop, etc.) then let's split those out into separate issues."
