username_0: ## Motivation

See https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/issues/5373

Docusaurus does not provide `og:type` at present.  It would be good if it did; perhaps with a value of `website` or `article`. eg:

```html
<meta property=""og:type"" content=""article"" />
```

This PR provides that support through a generic meta tags mechanism which is used *only* by the blog mechanism at present.  Blogs get the `og:type` of `article` as well as some article data, powered by the metadata available:

```js
 {
        'og:type': 'article',
        'article:published_time': date,
        ...(authorURL ? {'article:author': authorURL} : {}),
        ...(frontMatter.tags
          ? {'article:tag': frontMatter.tags.join(',')}
          : {}),
 }
```

### Have you read the [Contributing Guidelines on pull requests](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-requests)?

Yes

## Test Plan

username_0: As listed in the [official docs about set of ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/ingress-minikube/), I found out that the ingress is not reachable by the browser. 

I created an ingress:
`kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/service/networking/example-ingress.yaml`

And added its mapping on the `/etc/hosts` file in my windows 10 home edition.

`192.168.49.2 hello-world.info`

Where 192.168.49.2 is the ip address of the ingress. 

Finally I tried opening the `hello-world.info` on the browser but the browser says 'This site can’t be reached'.

Curl command also gave no response.
`curl hello-world.info`

What is the solution ??
<issue_comment>username_1: Hi @username_0 

Would you be willing to describe the context for your findings? We'd want to know what kind of cluster you ran it on (eg: local minikube? minikube from Katacoda as found in that task page? something else), the version of that cluster, and whether you deviated from any of the steps.

username_0: I've noticed that detekt is treating extension properties as regular properties.
Opened issue on detekt: https://github.com/detekt/detekt/issues/3532
Lead to proposal: https://github.com/detekt/detekt/pull/3559

Yet that change would be unclear as this is not part of the spec at all. Thus proposing the following change.
<issue_comment>username_1: This is not stale. I think that it should be merged or at least denied by a human telling why it should not be merged.
<issue_comment>username_2: Hey! We're currently testing some automation to help us handle PR from contributors in time. Sorry for not responding for so long. We'll review your suggestion in a couple of days.
<issue_comment>username_3: This addition contradicts the spirit of the Kotlin style guide which explicitly does not tries to mandate any order and says: "" ""Choose an order (either higher-level stuff first, or vice versa) and stick to it."" It is up to specific projects and tools to decide upon any specific ordering requirements if they wish to enforce them.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thats true, but guys from detekt told me, that this has unless it's in doc, they won't approve it.
The problem is, that extension properties are treated as regular properties, which I believe is wrong. Yet the doc does not states what the ext property is.
Any suggestion how to rephrase it to fit both needs?
<issue_comment>username_3: Kotlin style guide does not enforce the ordering for a reason. We have found that it is hard to come up with rock-solid ordering rules even for our own code, so we've bailed out of trying to solve it. 

It is up to detekt team to decide upon such rules if they wish to tackle this issue to have ordering enforced automatically.
<issue_comment>username_0: I got your point. I don't require the doc to contain info about order.
I would like the doc to state what the extension property is. Is it property? Is it function? Is it neither one of them?
<issue_comment>username_3: I don't see how that kind of information is related to Kotlin's style guide.
<issue_comment>username_0: You cannot say to not force order on properties unless you start calling them ""properties"". The doc says nothing about extensions. It doesn't even give a hint how they should be treated. I don't require to tell where they should be, but current state gives everyone chnace to mix them with methods(which they effectively are), or treating them like properties(which they look like). Which gives too much power and can be even harmful and error prone from my POV.
If that ends up with mixing the extension properties into regular properties, it's super confusing for the reader.

So I don't want to state how to order them, but how not to order them in a first place. To avoid code being error prone and confusing for the reader. Hope this is clear explanation why.
<issue_comment>username_3: This kind of decision is simply out of the scope of this particular document. It does not belong here.

username_0: Currently, if you organize your content into bundles, you would have to do something like this to create new content with the archetype system:

```bash
hugo new post/my-post/index.md
```

This works as expected, but the added power of bundles with its resource handling (image processing etc.) is screaming for some better support in this department.

This issue suggests that we add complete directories below `/archetypes`, and it will be used as a base to create a new bundle (or whatever).

Combine that with a `archetypes/post
```bash
archetypes
├── default.md
└── post-bundle
    ├── bio.md
    ├── images
    │   └── featured.jpg
    └── index.md
```

```bash
hugo new --kinde post-bundle post/my-post
```

Will create a new folder in `/content/post/my-post` with the same set of files as in the `post-bundle` archetypes folder. 

The handling is simple:

* We do nothing with the file- or directory names. 
* We parse and execute the content files (md, asciidoc etc.) as Go templates (like we do today) to enable dynamic values.
* All other files (images etc.) is just copied.<issue_closed>"

### Describe why this important to you

As a customer, to discover the full potential of integration options, I'd like to be able to discover the Telemetry SDK's or Flex as options for creating integrations, since they are both very powerful solutions.

None.

<issue_comment>username_2: A few notes on this: 

• This section was previously hidden/unindexed but don't think we can do that on github site.
• The docs are currently out of order; the first doc should be the 'Intro to Integrations SDK', which does include some info about other ways to create integrations. 
• Maybe we just rename this category from 'Create integrations' to 'Infra integrations SDK' or something more descriptive, less general.
<issue_comment>username_1: We've also noted the `Create integrations` section should not be there. We are planning to tackle that as part of #587 and move those docs to the proper location.<issue_closed>
