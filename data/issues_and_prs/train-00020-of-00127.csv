username_0: It's been a long time since we last added new contributors to the project.

It's a bit of manual labor, since I use a customized script to determine all new committers since a given date which are not already project contributors. Then we need someone with admin rights on GitHub to add those people to the website team. This has been done by @mikeal in the past, we need to find someone who is willing to take over â€¦
<issue_comment>username_1: Finding new contributors could possibly be done by adding functionality to the https://github.com/nodejs/github-bot if someone feels for a challenge.

As for adding people into the nodejs organisation, there has been a somewhat controversial discussion using a bot for that as well. Maybe @username_3 has some updates around that, as he has given that a shot more than once..
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 Wii you write code for nodejs-github-bot to add collaborators?

Any member of the CTC or TSC is empowered to add people you ask them to. In fact, that is one of their specific duties. It would be good to have some of those folks getting familiar with doing it.

@username_4 Still working on that, I'll let you know.

@username_2 I'm currently quite busy with a client project, so it still may take some time.

<issue_comment>username_0: @username_4 @username_8 @username_7 Can someone please add the new contributors to the website team?
<issue_comment>username_6: @username_0 FWIW it looks like you're a maintainer (assuming we're talking about [nodejs/website](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/teams/website/members)) so you should be able to add anyone who's already in the org to the team.

I think you still need an [owner](https://github.com/orgs/nodejs/people?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=%20role%3Aowner) to add new people to the org of course.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_6 I know, that's why we need an org owner to add new folks.
<issue_comment>username_7: I don't think I can add folks to the org, unfortunately ðŸ˜¬
<issue_comment>username_0: Ok, let's ask one of the org's owners for help.
