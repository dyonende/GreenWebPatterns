Unfortunately, an error has occurred:

This error is likely caused by:
        - The kubelet is not running
        - The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroupsdisabled)

If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
        - 'systemctl status kubelet'
        - 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'

Additionally, a control plane component may have crashed or exited when started by the container runtime.
To troubleshoot, list all containers using your preferred container runtimes CLI, e.g. docker.
Here is one example how you may list all Kubernetes containers running in docker:
        - 'docker ps -a | grep kube | grep -v pause'
        Once you have found the failing container, you can inspect its logs with:
        - 'docker logs CONTAINERID'

So far, the Open Distro documentation has been updated and moved to OpenSearch, and there have been continued additions to content coverage on OpenSearch plugin features, OpenSearch search, fundamental OpenSearch language clients content, OpenSearch APIs (e.g., CAT, bulk, DSL), and other ad hoc content based on basis address community requests (e.g., updating security content, updating docker configs, and more). \r\n\r\nDespite the significant progress, we haven’t established a plan we can work backwards from specific set of needs. Additionally, the current documentation is still structured in a manner better suited for a peripheral product (e.g. Open Distro). \r\n\r\n### Proposal\r\nTo resolve this, I am recommending an update to the basic hierarchy of content as well as the overall content subjects I think should be covered by the documentation site. In this proposal I tried to consider the following:\r\n\r\n* The structure should be flexible enough to allow the OpenSearch project documentation to change as the overall project changes. It will also need to be able to be reviewed and refreshed periodically. \r\n* The structure should be suitable for all readers. While we can’t optimize for every type of user, we should endeavor to support all. \r\n* Not all content will be reviewed in the same context so the structure scheme should allow for some repetition. \r\n* We should structure the documents to support both information-oriented reference material and goal-oriented how-to material. \r\n* The goal should be to reduce as much cognitive load in looking for content as possible\r\n\r\nWhile I framed this as a table of contents and described what sections I think we should have in our documentation, I also want to acknowledge that there are many more decisions to be made (e.g. how we title the content, what interlinks we have, what navigation looks like throughout, etc.). Those topics are important and need to be discussed. However, the structure and documentation content seemed to be the most composable, logical place to start. Once we feel good about the initial organization schemes and structures, we should review proposals for labeling, navigation, search, etc.\r\n\r\nFinally, while there is some importance in ordering (e.g. overview should probably be high on the list), I’ve focused on coverage for this proposal. I think we can make efforts optimizing the ordering once we have aligned on the content. \r\n\r\n#### Recommended Structure\r\nBelow is the general proposal for the section and structure of the content needed for the OpenSearch project. \r\n\r\n* *Overview*: As the name implies, this section provides an overview of OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards including concepts, paths to community content (ex. roadmaps, current design docs, etc.), and release/end-of-life information. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Project Overview and Concepts\r\n    * First steps and Learning Progressions\r\n    * Roadmap\r\n    * Design documents/RFCs\r\n    * Releases\r\n    * End of Life\r\n    * FAQ\r\n* *Installation and Configuration*: This section will demonstrate how to install and configure OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards including install requirements and examples for common configurations. It will also include content specific to upgrading from common systems or versions. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Installation Overview and Concepts\r\n    * Planning\r\n    * Installing on <Platform>\r\n    * Upgrading\r\n    * Configuration\r\n    * Configuring multiple node types\r\n* *Manage, Monitor, and Tune*: This section will focus on methods, instructions, and guidelines to run OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards including Performance Analyzer. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Performance Analyzer\r\n* *Migration*: This section will provide content on migrating to OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards from various common sources (ex. Open Distro, older version of OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, etc.).Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Overview and concepts\r\n    * From Open Distro\r\n    * From OSS Elasticsearch\r\n    * From Elasticsearch\r\n    * From Other Databases\r\n* *Security*: This section will provide both an overviews of security (include key concepts) and configuration options/guidance including authorization, authentication, and auditing. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Overview and concepts\r\n    * How-to/tutorials\r\n    * Configuration\r\n    * Authentication\r\n    * Access control\r\n    * Auditing\r\n* *Indexes and ingestion*: This section will be all about the ins and outs of the OpenSearch index including reindexing, aliases, and overall index management. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Overview and concepts\r\n    * Index templates\r\n    * Units and data types\r\n    * Indexing APIs\r\n    * Indexing back pressure\r\n    * Reindexing\r\n    * Index aliases\r\n    * Data Streams\r\n    * Index Management\r\n    * Ingestion Nodes\r\n* *Search and Query:* This section will provide an overview of search and query concepts as well as provide information on query options across OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Overview and concepts\r\n    * Search (e.g. Query DSL, Search Templates, Autocomplete, etc.)\r\n    * Query languages (e.g. DSL, SSL, SQL, etc.)\r\n    * Cross Cluster Search\r\n    * Machine Learning (e.g. KNN)\r\n    * Aggregations\r\n    * SQL\r\n* *Availability and Recovery*: This section will cover all the guidance needed for snapshots, cluster replication (and cross cluster replication), and recovery methods. It will also include information to optimize for availability. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Overview\r\n    * Snapshots\r\n    * Cluster Replication\r\n    * Cross Cluster Replication\r\n* *Analytics, Dashboards, and Machine Learning*: This section will catch the information needed to use OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards for analytics, visualization, and dashboarding including alerting, reporting, and OpenSearch Dashboard specific “how-tos”. This section will also cover using tools in OpenSearch Dashboards such as Dev Tools and Stack Management. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Overview and concepts\r\n    * OpenSearch Dashboards\r\n    * Alerting\r\n    * Anomaly Detection\r\n[Truncated]\n    * Ingestion tools (e.g. Data Prepper, Logstash, Fluentd, Tika, etc.)\r\n    * Data collection agents (e.g. Beats, Fluent Bit, etc.)\r\n    * Language Clients (e.g. Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.)\r\n    * Analytics tools (e.g. Grafana, Power BI, Tableau, etc.)\r\n    * OpenTelemetry\r\n    * OpenSearch Benchmark\r\n* *Troubleshooting*: This section will focus on resolving common challenges such as troubleshooting configuration issues and fixing security issues. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Common issues\r\n    * securityadmin.sh\r\n    * TLS\r\n    * SAML\r\n    * OpenID\r\n* *REST API Reference*: This section will provide a breakdown of the REST API and demonstrate what can be called to  configure or access OpenSearch functions. \r\n* *External links*: This section will provide a path to external links and associated documents not part of the core reference documentation. Topics in this section include;\r\n    * Javadoc \r\n    * OpenSearch developer guide\r\n    * Dashboards developer guide\r\n\r\n**What are remaining open questions?**\r\nWhile I tried to focus on what documentation users would be looking for based on feedback on the forums, GitHub, and looking at examples of other OSS projects, I know there is still a big opportunity for optimization. ***Please poke holes, provide feedback, identify gaps, and make proposals***!

username_0: ### Background
Since the launch of OpenSearch, there has been some great progress in documenting the project. So far, the Open Distro documentation has been updated and moved to OpenSearch, and there have been continued additions to content coverage on OpenSearch plugin features, OpenSearch search, fundamental OpenSearch language clients content, OpenSearch APIs (e.g., CAT, bulk, DSL), and other ad hoc content based on basis address community requests (e.g., updating security content, updating docker configs, and more). 

Despite the significant progress, we haven’t established a plan we can work backwards from specific set of needs. Additionally, the current documentation is still structured in a manner better suited for a peripheral product (e.g. Open Distro). 

### Proposal
To resolve this, I am recommending an update to the basic hierarchy of content as well as the overall content subjects I think should be covered by the documentation site. In this proposal I tried to consider the following:

* The structure should be flexible enough to allow the OpenSearch project documentation to change as the overall project changes. It will also need to be able to be reviewed and refreshed periodically. 
* The structure should be suitable for all readers. While we can’t optimize for every type of user, we should endeavor to support all. 
* Not all content will be reviewed in the same context so the structure scheme should allow for some repetition. 
* We should structure the documents to support both information-oriented reference material and goal-oriented how-to material. 
* The goal should be to reduce as much cognitive load in looking for content as possible

While I framed this as a table of contents and described what sections I think we should have in our documentation, I also want to acknowledge that there are many more decisions to be made (e.g. how we title the content, what interlinks we have, what navigation looks like throughout, etc.). Those topics are important and need to be discussed. However, the structure and documentation content seemed to be the most composable, logical place to start. Once we feel good about the initial organization schemes and structures, we should review proposals for labeling, navigation, search, etc.

Finally, while there is some importance in ordering (e.g. overview should probably be high on the list), I’ve focused on coverage for this proposal. I think we can make efforts optimizing the ordering once we have aligned on the content.

**What are remaining open questions?**
While I tried to focus on what documentation users would be looking for based on feedback on the forums, GitHub, and looking at examples of other OSS projects, I know there is still a big opportunity for optimization. ***Please poke holes, provide feedback, identify gaps, and make proposals***! From there we can use this issue as a living roadmap we all can add to and plan our documentation efforts.
<issue_comment>username_1: Amazing breakdown! I don't see much here about development docs. Will that be covered separately in the OpenSeach and OpenSeach dashboards developer guides?
<issue_comment>username_0: Great callout! I think it would make sense to add them in the developer guides but we can also link them in the main overview. What do you think?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1: Still learning everything of course. Could you describe the distinction between the overall OpenSearch documentation and the ""development docs"". I assume the development docs you are referring to are these: https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#developer-guide.

If so, should we make a distinction between ""Development"" and ""Contribution""? Either way, adding the links to the various guides in the main overview make sense to me.
<issue_comment>username_2: On the troubleshooting section: 

```
Troubleshooting: This section will focus on resolving common challenges such as troubleshooting configuration issues and fixing security issues. Topics in this section include;

    Common issues
    securityadmin.sh
    TLS
    SAML
    OpenID
```
I'm conflicted about making that section it's own. Would it be better to have individual ""Troubleshooting"" subsections within each section. For example, the security plugin docs could include a page for troubleshooting TLS, SAML, and security admin.

Furthermore, we could make ""Common Issues"" it's own top-level page, to account for issues that might not fit into the Use Case sections.

Any thoughts?
<issue_comment>username_1: By dev docs I meant documentation that new contributors can use to familiarize themselves with the internals of our systems. Looking at Andrews list, I see a lot that helps new users understand OpenSeach but for new contributors, there are still a lot of gaps. 

For example, for OpenSeach Dashboards the only section I see is a link to the dev guide. Which makes sense for an OpenSeach user. But if someone wishes to contribute to Dashboards, the existing documentation is quite sparse. And the developer guide doesn't do much more than give us setup instructions and the style guide to follow.
<issue_comment>username_1: I might be wrong, but I don't think we have  a good developer guide. In dashboards we have a single developer doc and that doesn't say much. It's just installation instructions and a style guide. We need a whole new set of docs for that. Ideally generated directly from the code.
<issue_comment>username_3: IMO, it would be great if docs could be moved into main repo like Elastic does it.  It is very useful to have docs live with the code so that contributors can add/update/remove the relevant docs in the same pull request.  It can be a requirement that changes are documented before a pull request is merged.
<issue_comment>username_0: This is interesting. I feel like making /doc (or /docs) a top-level directory in the ""main"" repository a good mechanism to signal the importance of documentation but I'm not sure how it would work given the distributed nature of the repos in the OpenSearch project specifically. 

@CEHENKLE @dblock what are your thoughts?
<issue_comment>username_0: My first instinct is why not both? We can have a general troubleshooting section where people can go to in addition to individual ""Troubleshooting"" subsections within each section. The content only needs to be written once and can them be discovered in either use flow (e.g. problem -> troubleshooting -> specific topic OR problem -> specific topic -> troubleshooting).
<issue_comment>username_0: This makes sense to me. The question then becomes: Where should they live in the above structure?
<issue_comment>username_4: So the general troubleshooting section would just link off to the individual troubleshooting sections, where people can find the actual content?
<issue_comment>username_2: Maybe a top-level section labeled ""Contribution"". 

---

_Contribution_: This section provides instructions and best practices for developing the OpenSearch project.
- Contribution pipeline and review overview
- OpenSearch development guide
- Dashboard's development guide
- Security Plugin development guide
<issue_comment>username_4: Ultimately, this is going to depend on how we define what the docs site's purpose is. This is how we're currently organizing the information:

Repos:

What is this thing?
How do get started with development and build it from source?
How do I contribute changes or bug fixes?
Documentation:

What is this thing?
How do I install it?
How do I get started with it?
Reference stuff: supported operations, configuration, tuning, best practices, REST API, etc.

So if we want to include developer guide content in OpenSearch documentation, then I'm not sure what information we'd put in the repos themselves, and we don't want duplicated information anywhere. My thinking is if first-time contributors are looking to contribute to the projects, then they're on the repos already, so why not stick the developer guide information like how to contribute and more in-depth explanations of systems in the repo's README? If the docs site's purpose is to document how to _use_ OpenSearch, then it doesn't make much sense to document how to _contribute_ to OpenSearch on the docs site.
<issue_comment>username_2: That is in line with how other Open Source tools operate, keep contribution instructions in the code base where contribution occurs. I do think there is value in having a hub in which we route users towards our repos though. For example, Elastic has a [Community Contribution Program](https://www.elastic.co/community/contributor), a hub for users which to contribute to Elastic. They gate their instructions behind a web app that requires you to sign-up, which I don't love. However, the page and app does encourage contributors by promising recognition for those that make significant contributions.
<issue_comment>username_1: So where would the details for building say a plugin go? To build a plugin today all we have is a blog post. But it does not for example contains the details of how to generate one, what are the different functional libraries available to a plugin developer, different key concepts that one should know before building one etc. 

I guess what i am looking for in the documentation is something like this:
https://developer.android.com/docs

Its not really a guide on how contribute to Android for example but how to build on top of it. And most of the contents are also very relevant to someone who's contributing.

The actual style guide and contribution specific details can and should remain in the repo, but guides, api, and other core concepts make more sense here
<issue_comment>username_4: Right, and that's why I'm saying we should decide what the purpose of the OpenSearch docs site is, and whether that should just be how to use OpenSearch VS everything OpenSearch-related. I would say that if users are looking at the plugin's repo to download, clone, do whatever with a plugin, they should be able to look at that repo's README to get the information they need, rather than jump through another hoop to the docs site.

I agree that guides and APIs should be in the OpenSearch documentation, but I think it makes more sense to have breakdowns on what libraries are available in a plugin/what to know when thinking about contributing to a plugin within the repo, where they would actually make contributions and where the code actually lives.

I like that Android development link because it educates people on how to _use_ Android to build custom apps. But they don't mention anything about contributing to Android, which is at an entirely different link: https://source.android.com/setup/contribute
<issue_comment>username_5: I'd like to call out what I feel is a gap in our existing docs - In the situation where someone might be learning **Docker and OpenSearch at the same time**, I found the amount of guidance just a bit short. We should probably provide a generous dose of help for some basic docker familiarity.  Some examples: 

Installation and Configuration - 

- Using `docker cp` to pull out yml files, make changes, and then `docker cp` them back in.  A corollary - it was also not quite clear where exactly the config file lives inside of the docker container, which I had to execute an interactive shell to figure out.  I realize the difficulty is low for that, but we should at least have it properly documented. 

- Attaching new volumes to containers to prepare them as a snapshot repository  through edits to `docker-compose.yml` prior to bringing up containers. New volumes cannot be attached to containers that have already been started.
<issue_comment>username_6: Regarding contribution - from someone who just enters OpenSearch as a developer (not a user), there is a huge gap of How OpenSearch Works: Internal Architecture / Design
* How does replication works?
* How does the Shard Allocator (Balancer) works?
* How do plugins work?

A lot of excellent content in that area has been contributed as blog posts. 
Today to learn those fields, I have to google, find all sorts of blogs posts, and piece it together. 

I think it makes sense to have a section in the docs about the architecture and design of OpenSearch. 

Here is an example of an issue I opened which has been closed since there is not such place to add that content to: https://github.com/opensearch-project/documentation-website/issues/426
<issue_comment>username_0: I think we could include some of this in the install guides for OpenSearch via Docker (under ""Installation and Configuration"" section) and link out to Docker content for any command deep dives. What do you think?
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_4 So, where are we landing on the structure? I can make an update if we feel we're aligned.
<issue_comment>username_6: @username_0 Looks good 👍
<issue_comment>username_7: I really like this. It's long over due and it's solving some long-standing concerns I've had. 

**Overall feedback**: There are a lot of sections. I think, as a user, I might get overwhelmed by this list. Laterally, I also don't like how several dissimilar things are is bundled together (""Analytics, Dashboards, and Machine Learning"" seems especially potpourri). I would suggest an additional layer of organization. Maybe three big areas - ""Setting up & running OpenSearch,"" ""Using OpenSearch for your data"" and ""OpenSearch internals & contribution"" and then a few other general ones (maybe Overview, external links, API reference).

**Other nits and picks**: 

""Security"" section: I would definitely break this up. This seems to cover the footprint of the security plugin which bundles a lot dissimilar functionality. I would say that access control needs its own category. Encryption might also be a good area to cover. (SSL is listed as a query language which is amusingly incorrect).

""Search and Query"" section: needs work. SSL is encryption - should it be PPL? No mention of DQL. SQL is listed twice.

""Clients and tools"" section: break this up. Languages and clients are apples and oranges. I think this historical more than anything.
<issue_comment>username_5: Perfect. I sure would like to not have any reason to have to visit a different website to get the practical information needed. I'll take it.
<issue_comment>username_1: Shouldn't we have a similar section for dashboards? 

Btw this is what I was referring to when I mentioned developer docs being different from the developer guide on the repository
<issue_comment>username_8: I agree.  Below is how I see it.

Clients:  This section will provide light documentation and links to download clients.
Clients include:  Python, JavaScript, Java, etc.


Tools:  This section will provide documentation for tools that are part of the OpenSearch project. Topics in this section include:

OpenSearch CLI
Ingestion tools (e.g. Data Prepper, Logstash, Fluentd, Tika, etc.)
Data collection agents (e.g. Beats, Fluent Bit, etc.)
Analytics tools (e.g. Grafana, Power BI, Tableau, etc.)
OpenTelemetry
OpenSearch Benchmark
<issue_comment>username_9: This is a big change and there are lots of `https://opensearch.org/docs` links out on the internet. I think it would be valuable to support redirecting old links to new links. Perhaps not every link could get a redirect, but a lot of the major pages should. As a user of documentation, I find it highly frustrating to follow an old link and then have to rework my way into the correct page.
<issue_comment>username_0: I've updated to reflect your input - let me know if that works!
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks @passbt I've added it explicit under query languages as well as the Dashboards section!
<issue_comment>username_0: @macrakis I've moved k-NN and search plugins under ""Optimization"" (which itself is under ""Search and Query""). What's your thought here - is this the right taxonomy?"

Totally agree that out of the box experience is very important.  But\nwhat I\'ve struggled with is what constitutes ""out of the box"" when someone\nis installing from Chocolatey NuGet (CNG).  You can run CNG from either the\nterminal window that comes up when you run cmd (cmd_shell) or the terminal\nwindow that comes up when you run powershell (ps_shell).  At the cmd_shell\ntyping _iex_ if iex.bat is in the path and the erlang runtime is in the\npath will work exactly as expected.  But in the ps_shell (and CNG is a\nbunch of powershell scripts) typing _iex_ will not start iex.bat but\ninstead will run the ""Invoke-Expression"" cmdlet.\n\nNow for most windows apps, you wouldn\'t even have to start a terminal\nwindow--you\'d have a shortcut on the desktop or something on the start menu\nor something like that.  But elixir is something that developers (as\nopposed to general end-users) use so starting a command line isn\'t so much\nof an issue.  But, as I say, which command line?  cmd_shell or\nps_shell--especially as I say, given that CNG is a bunch of PS scripts and\ngiven that the most likely person to install the Elixir CNG package is a\ndeveloper who might prefer ps_shell over cmd_shell.\n\n2.) I don\'t know about other Windows users but for me, I don\'t want\napplications automatically adding themselves to my path.  This is for two\nreasons:\n\na.) This is my development machine; I don\'t want the environment changed\nunless I change it myself.  Could cause me problems with my development\nwork.\n\nb.) The path can only be 256 characters long and every app that adds itself\nto the path is taking up space in that 256 characters.\n\nHence I felt that even though the out of the box experience would suffer, I\nwould avoid automatically appending either Erlang or Elixir\'s binary\ndirectories to the path.  As I say, again, I\'m inclined to believe that\nmost of the folks looking at Elixir via CNG are developers and while it\'s a\nbit annoying not to have ""iex"" work out of the box, since they are\ndevelopers I would hope they can understand the reasoning. I guess I have\nbeen a bit lax about documenting the reasoning for the choice and\nexplaining what someone needs to do in order to get it so that ""iex"" works\nas expected at a cmd_shell prompt.\n\n3.) As I say since I primarily use the ps_shell, I got tired of forgetting\nto type ""iex.bat"" as opposed to ""iex"" so I created the ""ielixir"" shortcut\nso I wouldn\'t keep forgetting.  I added it to the CNG package as a\nconvenience for others. But it was an addition; the behavior of iex in\nrelation to Windows is exactly the same as it was before.  That is someone\nstill needs to add the Erlang and Elixir binary directories to their path\nthemselves if they want to run ""iex.bat"" in the ps_shell.  As I say this is\nbecause I\'m guessing that most people looking at this are developers.\n\n4.) I think I should probably make a PR to supplement the docs to explain\nexactly what I explained above since this question seems to come up all the\ntime for those who install the CNG version to play with Elixir.\n\nSo having said all that, if you want Jose, I can modify the 1.1.0-rc0 CNG\npackage to add a shimmed shortcut to iex.bat to the path.  But the problem\nwith ps_shell will still remain.  And it has been my impression that there\nare a lot of sysadmins who are converting to using ps_shell (as opposed to\ncmd_shell) on a more regular basis because the scripting language in\nps_shell is a lot more powerful than the old Windows batch files.\n\nIf you want me to do a PR for the docs to document my choices for the CNG\npackage, just let me know.  I\'m happy to write this up.  Or maybe a FAQ on\nthe install packages or something of that sort.  This question about ""iex""\nnot working seems to come up almost as often as why strings are displayed\nfor lists of chars and why values can be _seemingly_ rebound.', 'title': None, 'type': 'comment'}

username_0: On the page http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html (and I assume other pages) it refers to iex. When I installed elixir using chocolatey, iex was not on my path, but ielixir was.
<issue_comment>username_1: Thank you @username_0!

@onoriocatenacci can you please confirm this is indeed the way to go?
<issue_comment>username_2: Hi Jose and Bruce,

Actually it's up to you Jose.  I didn't get rid of iex on Windows; I simply added ielixir as a shortcut for the iex.bat file.  That is the only file that I aliased because it's the only one that presents a problem with Powershell.  I mean to say that a person can use the ielixir shortcut from either a powershell terminal window or the old windows cmd terminal window but you can't type ""iex"" in the Powershell window--you need to type iex.bat.  So I added ielixir as an alternative for that case. 

It only applies when someone downloads the ChocolateyNuGet package and it is just a secondary shortcut; iex.bat and the rest all still work.  I think I can add iex.bat to the path as well--I say ""I think"" because of the Windows shimming technology I'm using to add the shortcut to ielixir.  I can double check this.

I could swear that I had sent something to the Elixir-Lang-Talk mailing list mentioning this additional shortcut but I can't seem to find it now.

At any rate, this is just a secondary shortcut that I added to the ChocolateyNuGet package--it only applies on Windows and it only applies when someone has run the CNG installer.  And, as I say, I'm not forcing anyone to use ielixir; it's there solely as a convenience for those who want to run Powershell as their terminal console.

What do you think Jose?  I can remove it (as I say I added it because Windows users should be using Powershell for a terminal and when you use Powershell for a terminal iex has a different meaning) or I can see if I can add iex to the path as well.  I could also document it if you want.  

Just let me know how you want to proceed.  Sorry if this caused you any inconvenience Bruce!

<issue_comment>username_2: By the way Jose if you want me to add iex.bat (and the rest) to the path, I should be able to make that change when I upload the 1.1.0-rc0 CNG package which I should have within the next day or two.
<issue_comment>username_0: Either way, but if the docs say ""iex"" and it doesn't work for the
chocolatey people (who, I suspect, are expecting a simple install), then it
can potentially turn some people away. I use the out-of-the-box experience
as part of a litmus test, so I think it's important.

On Tue, Sep 15, 2015 at 4:36 PM,
<issue_comment>username_1: Thank you @username_2! Don't worry, you did everything perfect.

@username_0 we say `iex.bat` the first time we run iex: http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html

Which part was confusing or unclear? Should we have a large disclaimer?
<issue_comment>username_2: I'll write this up partially to explain my thinking and partially so it's
documented.

1.) Totally agree that out of the box experience is very important.  But
what I've struggled with is what constitutes ""out of the box"" when someone
is installing from Chocolatey NuGet (CNG).  You can run CNG from either the
terminal window that comes up when you run cmd (cmd_shell) or the terminal
window that comes up when you run powershell (ps_shell).  At the cmd_shell
typing _iex_ if iex.bat is in the path and the erlang runtime is in the
path will work exactly as expected.  But in the ps_shell (and CNG is a
bunch of powershell scripts) typing _iex_ will not start iex.bat but
instead will run the ""Invoke-Expression"" cmdlet.

Now for most windows apps, you wouldn't even have to start a terminal
window--you'd have a shortcut on the desktop or something on the start menu
or something like that.  But elixir is something that developers (as
opposed to general end-users) use so starting a command line isn't so much
of an issue.  But, as I say, which command line?  cmd_shell or
ps_shell--especially as I say, given that CNG is a bunch of PS scripts and
given that the most likely person to install the Elixir CNG package is a
developer who might prefer ps_shell over cmd_shell.

2.) I don't know about other Windows users but for me, I don't want
applications automatically adding themselves to my path.  This is for two
reasons:

a.) This is my development machine; I don't want the environment changed
unless I change it myself.  Could cause me problems with my development
work.

b.) The path can only be 256 characters long and every app that adds itself
to the path is taking up space in that 256 characters.

Hence I felt that even though the out of the box experience would suffer, I
would avoid automatically appending either Erlang or Elixir's binary
directories to the path.  As I say, again, I'm inclined to believe that
most of the folks looking at Elixir via CNG are developers and while it's a
bit annoying not to have ""iex"" work out of the box, since they are
developers I would hope they can understand the reasoning. I guess I have
been a bit lax about documenting the reasoning for the choice and
explaining what someone needs to do in order to get it so that ""iex"" works
as expected at a cmd_shell prompt.

3.) As I say since I primarily use the ps_shell, I got tired of forgetting
to type ""iex.bat"" as opposed to ""iex"" so I created the ""ielixir"" shortcut
so I wouldn't keep forgetting.  I added it to the CNG package as a
convenience for others. But it was an addition; the behavior of iex in
relation to Windows is exactly the same as it was before.  That is someone
still needs to add the Erlang and Elixir binary directories to their path
themselves if they want to run ""iex.bat"" in the ps_shell.  As I say this is
because I'm guessing that most people looking at this are developers.

4.) I think I should probably make a PR to supplement the docs to explain
exactly what I explained above since this question seems to come up all the
time for those who install the CNG version to play with Elixir.

So having said all that, if you want Jose, I can modify the 1.1.0-rc0 CNG
package to add a shimmed shortcut to iex.bat to the path.  But the problem
with ps_shell will still remain.  And it has been my impression that there
are a lot of sysadmins who are converting to using ps_shell (as opposed to
cmd_shell) on a more regular basis because the scripting language in
ps_shell is a lot more powerful than the old Windows batch files.

If you want me to do a PR for the docs to document my choices for the CNG
package, just let me know.  I'm happy to write this up.  Or maybe a FAQ on
the install packages or something of that sort.  This question about ""iex""
not working seems to come up almost as often as why strings are displayed
for lists of chars and why values can be _seemingly_ rebound.
<issue_comment>username_1: For Windows, we will always tell users to use `iex.bat`. I believe this is orthogonal to the Chocolatey discussion because that's the only way afaik to run Elixir across all windows shells and installers. That's problem 1: make it clear that Windows users need to run `iex.bat`.

Problem 2: should Chocolatey add things to my PATH, regardless if `iex.bat` or `ielixir`? That's not up to me to answer. I think you should just follow Chocolatey best practices here and Chocolatey users will be aware of what should be done. If we want to keep it as is, without copying, then may be should add a tiny note to the install page under the Chocolatey instructions that says: ""Elixir executables are not added to your PATH automatically. Do x, y, z to add them"".
<issue_comment>username_2: Ok Jose that makes good sense to me. I can modify the CNG installer, as I
say, when I create the package for 1.1.0-rc0--which should be today around
my lunchtime. :)
<issue_comment>username_2: Ok, just to put a final conclusion on this discussion:

1.) I've modified the Elixir 1.1.0-rc0 installer to create a shortcut to
""iex.bat"" and I've modified the installer to insure that people are told
they need to type ""iex.bat"" at the command prompt.

2.) Since ""iex.bat"" works for both the cmd shell and the powershell shell
there's no need for ielixir and I've removed it.

3.) If you want me to modify the docs to specify ""iex.bat"" for Windows,
just let me know.  I can do a PR when I get a chance.

4.) I've uploaded the 1.1.0-rc0 CNG package to CNG.  I may make an
announcement later but I sometimes think people get tired of hearing me
announce things :)

We already do this but maybe we should be clearer.
I don't know what to change though.

Thanks for all the changes and improvements Onorio!
<issue_comment>username_2: I'm always glad to do what I can to help Jose.

Take a look at my announcement of the CNG package on Elixir Lang Talk.  We
need to explicitly document that someone needs to type the string ""iex.bat""
at a command prompt because on Windows normally you can run a batch file
without having to type the extension.  That is a Windows user would expect
to type ""iex"" (no extension) and have it run iex.bat.  We've just changed
it such that someone will need to type ""iex.bat"" (with the extension).
It's down to making it clear that they will need to type the extension
which they normally wouldn't.

<issue_comment>username_0: The path length appears to be 2047, with 4095 for Windows 7 and later:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/limitation-to-the-length-of-the-system-path-variable

I'm not suggesting whether it be iex or ielixir; just that, once the user
does an installation, whatever the documentation says should work without
additional adjustments to the path.

<issue_comment>username_2: Wow--I guess that shows how long I've been working on Windows.  That about
only 256 chars may even go back to the days of DOS. Good to know that about
the path.

Regardless the CNG package for Elixir 1.1.0-rc.0 now contains a shortcut to
iex.bat.  But you will need to type ""iex.bat"" (with the file extension) to
start it.  But it's not finished just yet (there are some problems that I
know about) and I hope to have it all fixed up for the Elixir 1.1.0 final
CNG package.

<issue_comment>username_2: For whatever it's worth, I just discovered why Bruce and I found such
different numbers.  The absolute path to a specific file in Windows can
never be more than 260 characters.
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365247(VS.85).aspx#maxpath  (The
MAX_PATH constant in the Windows API) This is what I was thinking of when I
mentioned the limit on path length.  As far as I can tell this still holds
with Windows 10 for whatever it's worth.

Bruce is right in that the length limit of the PATH environment variable is
much more than 260 characters and, of course, it's referring to something
totally different. It was my misremembering of the Windows API that led me
to mistakenly believe that the same limitation would apply on the
environment variable.

It's really sort of beside the point in this discussion anyway but I add
this note here for future reference.  It seems that we were both sort of
right but Bruce was more right than I in this context. It's a moot question
anyway since I've modified the CNG installer to put Elixir in the path
anyway.

username_0: 
<issue_comment>username_0: Some nice clicks made
<issue_comment>username_0: So here's our comment style, if I'm not wrong:
 - Starts with uppercase letter if the comment is a sentence.
 - Ends with a period if the comment is the sentence.
 - The above 2 styles aren't applied to inline comments.
 - Won't start with an uppercase letter or end with a period if the comment is not a sentence.
 
When a comment is a sentence in this case? When it includes a verb.
<issue_comment>username_1: Good job, you two!

@username_0 please consider adding suggestions to a batch and then committing once. This will save us from having a bunch of similar commits, which makes it easier to review.

Will review more thoroughly when out of draft state.

<issue_comment>username_1: When going through another person's review, instead of clicking ""commit suggestion"" 22 times, go to the files tab, then click ""add suggestion to batch"" 22 times, and perform a single commit that collects all changes.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks, got you!
<issue_comment>username_1: @linbuxiao @username_2 it's sufficient if you review the few changes to the Chinese translations.
<issue_comment>username_2: LGTM, but do I need to change the corresponding translation in this PR, or I can do it in #98 which I still working on.

<issue_comment>username_0: Same.

I'll let you two decide on the exact conventions we use, and where to apply them. Just be sure to ping me once you agreed on stuff, so that I can
- adapt to the new rules when writing future articles, and
- make sure that both languages have the same code examples.
<issue_comment>username_0: Comment rules:
 - Start with an uppercase letter and include a period at the end if the comment included a sentence, this doesn't apply for inline comments.
 - Inline comments start with a lowercase and won't have periods in their end in any way.

List rules:
 - List items have nothing in common between them, No need for "","".
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1, the above is everything so far.
<issue_comment>username_0: And we're not forced to follow those instructions everytime, we should follow them in regular times only. For example, if we needed to have more clarity somewhere, we can break them,
<issue_comment>username_1: Understood. Regarding lists, I tend to write sentences with an enumeration that is simply formatted as a list. Example:

grammY is
- simple,
- fast, and
- powerful

and therefore a good choice for your bot.

Would you advise to rather break the rule, or to avoid such sentences?
<issue_comment>username_0: I don't know where you took that style from, but I haven't seen splitting a sentence with a list like you do throughout my life.

I'd just write:

grammY is:
 - grammY
 - Simple
 - Fast
 - Powerful
 - Stunning
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks!"
