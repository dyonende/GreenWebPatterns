<issue_comment>username_0: Short update as I experiment:

I tried the -s flag and everything downloads but there is one caveat.

The -a leaves me with a beautiful tree directory
The -s leaves me a tree, one directory per snapshot.

New question, **is there any way to enjoy the power `-s `gives me while still enjoying the beautifully laid out tree folder directory structure that the `-a` flag provides?**

username_0: So Im a new to github / VSCode / and Cloud Hosting Services but maybe someone can help with this bug im having.

So initially I tried executing this github package by using heroku, and it worked!

However I wanted to make a custom PHP bridge and add it to the /bridges/ directory.. but I just couldnt figure out how to edit the backend files on heroku... it seemed to only host exactly what you all have on this repository (which I cannot edit) so I gave up on heroku.

So Then I looked up vercel and it was pretty nice... but it dosent seem to support the php framework like heroku... so what I did was on vercel I installed this PHP framework addon by Juicyfx at https://github.com/juicyfx/vercel-php

Now I tried to read the readme but that jargon is way over my head, so I gathered from it that aslong as I link the repository, I can deploy this new app called vercel+ php

and in order to execute my php code i just have to add any php package to the /api/ directory and aslong as index.php shows up, I can deploy it.

so I made my own github repository copy of rssbridge, and literally copied and pasted these files to the /api/ directory and then I deployed it.

so when I go on vercel and deploy the app, it takes me to the url. then I just amended the url to have /api at the end, and its launching the rssbridge... but maybe because vercel or the juicyfx php framework is deploying it, I am getting this error

RSS-Bridge does not have write permissions for /var/task/user/api/lib/../cache/!

does anyone know how to fix it? I really love vercel and I would love to get this working on that site if someone has a workaround
<issue_comment>username_1: If you only want your own bridge, fork the original repo and add the bridge to the bridges folder. The deploy your repo to heroku using the button.

Or: fork the repo, create a new branch ( yourbridge), add your new bridge and then create a pull request to this repo. Then your bridge can be used by everyone
<issue_comment>username_2: When I played with heroku in 2016, project directory was mounted as readonly. Pretty sure same happens in vercel.
That cache directory is used to store cache as files. You can try to switch cache method to memcached. See `config.default.ini.php` for details.
<issue_comment>username_0: OK , after searching around I found 2 tools which just do an inspect element search and create  an RSS feed reader based on the parameters. These function extremely well as a ""catch all"" tool, which is programed by the user rather than specifically for a URL.
for reference please see 
fetchrss.com and reed43.com

Is there a bridge does this function on a URL, where I can input the variables like we do on these bridges, but instead the variables are start and stop CSS identifiers  ?
<issue_comment>username_1: I feel like you're going waaaay around the bend for an easy solution. 

1. Fork this repo
2. Create your bridge in the bridges folder
3. Create a whitelist.txt in the base of the repo (where the whitelist.default.txt is)
4. Add your new bridge to that whitelist
5. Deploy to heroku

If you're not firm in the bridge generation: What site do you want to create an rss feed for? Maybe I'll give it a swing.
<issue_comment>username_0: well the reason I posted my comment on 6/17/2021 is because I would like 1 bridge that is dynamic.

1 bridge that I can use no matter how many URLS I want to filter, and no matter how many stylistic revisions that site undergoes. 

I appreciate you giving it a swing, but if I give a URL I would be receiving a static code / algorithm for a static site. and if any changes occur, then I would have to go back and revise it :(

This is why im pretty inlove with fetchrss.com and reed43.com, because the way they structured it works with any URL that i can inspect element and filter the CSS. however Im allergic to the cost structure XD.

so I was wondering if there is a way to make a catch all bridge. one with variables such as Site URL, Start CSS identifier #1, End CSS Identifier #1, and RSS output tag #1 (link / image etc).

and then once these variables are filled out, it goes to the page, and searches the css and outputs the data inbetween the start and end identifers.

this was if the URL changes, or if the coding changes, all I have to do is update my URL, or update my CSS identifiers. That would be AWESOME! and then deploy on my heroku so I always how the power of it!

username_0: Hello, I've found a wonderful static comment system Staticman ([https://staticman.net/](https://staticman.net/)). Can anyone add it to our Beautiful Jekyll? :D Thank you very much!
<issue_comment>username_1: beautful jekyll already supports a very powerful and very popular comment system called Disqus. It's extremely easy to enable it on your site and it's used by thousands and thousands of people so you can be assured it works well. I don't see why a different comment system that's fairly unknown and untested should be supported when disqus already works?
<issue_comment>username_0: But there are many people (including me) from my country - Viet Nam having problem with disqus comment system. Maybe Disqus is blocked by some ISPs? And I think it also happens on other countries.

Further more, with Staticman commenting system, we can keep all comments in Github repository instead of have them stored in Disqus server. Many people will love it.
<issue_comment>username_1: You're right, I had no idea Disqus is blocked there. Anyway, I just looked at staticman and it looks like if you want to use it, you'll just need to add it manually yourself. There isn't much to add to the template in order to support it because it has different implementations depending on your use case. So all you need to do is to follow their instructions, but I don't think it can be generalized into a theme<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_0: Ok. thank you.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 As an Octopress and Disqus user for three years (my GitHub Pages), I can provide another rationale for @username_0's request for Staticman support.  I suffered from the URL change after switching timezone.  I tried refactoring the comment paths on Disqus's online platform, but the embedded box in my old blog still display the wrong hyperlinks.

More importantly, under Disqus's model, every time a page with Disqus comments is loaded, one has to wait for Disqus's response.
Provided that the blog receives comments occasionally, Staticman fits the needs of blog owners better than Disqus in terms of SEO and load speed.

Nonetheless, thx @username_1 for this great theme based on which Beautiful Hugo is created.

@username_0 The later theme has native Staticman support, so you may consider switching to Hugo, which is powered by Go.  Golang is much faster than Ruby.  I used to wait for a minute for my old Octopress 2.0 blog with over 300 articles.  Last week, I published halogenica/beautifulhugo#222 for Staticman's nested comment support.

Issue: return non-existing empty object, return bad `oldPrice` for promo game.

In the same way of `hasPromo` we can use a boolean `isBuyable` for game without price.

username_0: My previous Google Analytics implementation wasn't working, only firing
on first visit. Google Tag Manager has the power to listen to history
changes and fire analytics events when they happen, so I've configured
Google Tag manager to do exactly that.

This means our analytics setup is now working perfectly and tracking
pageviews as it should.

Resolves ticket https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/vsp-5cedc9cce6e3335dc5a49fc4/issues/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team/26017

Moves `#kampyleButtonContainer` (the Feedback button) from the end `<body>` to the end of `<main>` so that users can tab to it much faster (they no longer have to tab through all the links in the footer to get to it).

The button and the visual placement of it is not changed in any way.

```
/**
 * Moves #kampyleButtonContainer (the container for the Feedback button
 * powered by Medallia) from the end of <body> to the end of <main> so
 * that users can tab to it more quickly.
 * Before, users had to tab through all the links in the footer to get
 * to the button.
 * When the button is clicked on, #nebula_div_btn is removed from the DOM.
 * When the form is closed, it gets added back.
 * This script also adds a listener for when #nebula_div_btn is added
 * back and sets the focus on #kampyleButtonContainer again.

username_0: ## 🚀 Feature Proposal for the site or the documentation

Add a section on the documentation/`selenium.dev` site for a brand guide/logo resources

## Motivation

I was looking for updated logo resources (similar to the question at https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/1063) for Selenium and could not find them.

## Example

Other projects such as [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/about/media-kit/logo-wordmark-guidelines) and the [Apache Software Foundation](https://www.apache.org/foundation/press/kit/#poweredby) have brand guides. Sorry if I'm just missing the one for Selenium.
