username_0: ----
The term ""incompatibility"" can also be a bit problematic IMO, so we maybe have to choose a more ""tame"" term in the app and the FAQ.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 I assume you would want to write or draft the articles? :)

In any case, we will try to further improve the articles with user feedback.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 
Do we know what percentage of users will see the partial incompatible issue or the full incompatibility issue? My guess is that partial incompatibility is very low numbers and full incompatibility almost zero.

At the moment the app is released for minimum API 23 (Android 6 and above) and BLE has been available since Android 4.1. It is not possible to install on a device earlier than Android 6 (neither through the Google Play Store, nor by sideloading). The only report in GitHub so far since the release of 2.2.1 was about an Android 6 device which did not support peripheral mode.

Users who install the app from Google Play Store are prevented from installing on a device with no Bluetooth support or with no Bluetooth Low Energy support, because this is ruled out by the current manifest file.

If the article is spilt, you could try structuring them so that the introduction is less technical (like the text you proposed) then further down the article provide more technical details for those who would like to know. When I added the version number I looked for a quick, simple and non-contentious change, so certainly this can be optimized and better integrated.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 We don't know the total number of users that are affected, but the numbers are indeed very low. However, they are not low enough to be insignificant because a few older but popular devices did not receive updates to support peripheral mode.

For the FP2, we know that peripheral mode was not supported with [Android 7 as the OS](https://forum.fairphone.com/t/corona-warn-app-von-fdroid-inkompatibel-auf-fp2/71072). They only recently fixed this with their Android 9 update. A Samsung device with Android 7 was also reported to have an incompatibility warning in the Play Store.
<issue_comment>username_2: Thanks for the info, will add it to CCTG FAQ.
<issue_comment>username_2: In the community slack, @username_3 shared a review by a user who was confused because the incompatibility warning was only sometimes showing. We should that this can happen when the status cannot be reliably detected.
<issue_comment>username_3: I hope that it is possible to find a good solution to prevent/to fix intermittent changes of the state. Hence, I propose to add something like ""currently there are a few reports of users who experience intermittent changes of the state. We're looking into this and will fix this in an upcoming release"" or similar...
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_2 and still all the best for the final exams! :D
<issue_comment>username_2: From looking at the code again, we reconstructed a more precise definition when this happens: if Android version < 8.0 and Bluetooth is turned off, detection doesn't work – then, no warning card is shown in any case.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_2 
It would be great to have an explanation of how the checks are done, just for a better understanding.

Also good luck from me for your Abi exams! ☘️ 🤞🏻
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_2 Fingers crossed!
<issue_comment>username_5: Also from my side! Good luck!
<issue_comment>username_0: I though about something like *""eingeschränkte Sendefähigkeit/limited usage""*, but that is even longer and probably too vague :D Maybe it should be ""XY not available"" where XY is something that describes peripheral mode.

The alerty warning triangle could be replaced with an ""info"" exclamation mark.

Anyway, good luck for your exams :)
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_5 @username_2 @username_1 @username_3 @username_4 

I've added a few reviews from the store, so we can better judge where the problems with the current message are. Most of them are misinterpretations of the warning card.
<issue_comment>username_2: I'm assuming you meant an ""(i)"" icon here?

I have opened a new Android issue to discuss these two items further: https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/3260
<issue_comment>username_1: I think a blog article would be good, combined with a mention in the new features section of the next version of the Android app. It's unfortunate that this didn't happen with the 2.2 Android release, which might have prepared users for the added warning. Probably most users will have automatically updated by now, so there will not be many new occurrences of the error message. Even so, it would be good to put out a message and make the reasoning clear to affected users (in addition to any changes to the FAQ article.)

It would be great if the reaction from users was that they are grateful for the additional tests done by the app, and grateful for the additional information, instead of just being annoyed.

Perhaps we could have a description of the problem:
- why didn't the Google Play Store detect the missing BLE functionality and prevent installation or provide a warning?
- why didn't the app check in earlier releases?

How was this solved in the 2.2 Android app versions?

What is the recommended course of action for a user getting an incompatibility message?

I have some ideas about how the app could be made more appealing, and I will post these soon to https://github.com/corona-warn-app/cwa-app-android/issues/3260.
<issue_comment>username_2: I opened #1291 to incorporate our ideas and am looking forward to your feedback.
<issue_comment>username_0: We will answer the Play Store reviews directly with an explanation (maybe even before 2.3 releases).
<issue_comment>username_1: I don't have an personal experience with a device which is incompatible, but I suspect that for most users of such devices that the only practical solution will be to update to a newer device. The devices which I have owned have always offered firmware updates automatically and I doubt if a device manufacturer will plan to update older firmware / device driver just because a user has contacted them.

The possibility that the only solution to the issue would be to update to a newer device is not mentioned, and I think it probably should be mentioned.
<issue_comment>username_2: I'm afraid that this is true. However, I am not in favor of adding the advice to buy a new device. It is, in most cases, not a practical solution. The (monetary and environmental) cost is at an imbalance with the benefit. For this reason, such an advice might upset users.

The should convey the advice: ""Your app is working fine and your device is okay, but be aware of this limitation.""

Of course depending on how this is formulated, adding the advice you proposed might make it sound more like: ""It is not a good idea to use the app on this device. Better get a new one.""
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_2 

- For partial incompatibility getting a new device is probably not worth it.
- For full incompatibility a new device is probably the only option if a user wants to have exposure notification capabilities linked to BLE. For environmental or cost concerns, there is also the option of obtaining a device second-hand. In any case that should be the user's decision. I just wanted to avoid raising a reader's hopes too high that they could solve the problem for their existing device.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 @username_2 

IMO recommending getting a new device wouldn't come across well because it is a very expensive solution. It will sound out of touch. Of course it depends how it's worded, but I would also not be in favour of putting it in.

I'm not entirely sure where you want the [docs](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-cache-assets) to be placed within the website, but I was thinking:

1. Add a permalink such as ""Cache Assets"" into the ""Plugins"" list in the ""Configuration"" section of the main docs. (Maybe ""Cache API Requests"" or ""Cache Requests"" would be a more suitable name)
2. Add eleventy-cache-assets [README.md](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-cache-assets#readme) content to a template for the actual page on the site.
3. Access the eleventy-cache-assets docs page from the ""Plugins"" list in the main docs using `<a href=""/docs/plugins/cache-assets/language/"">Cache Assets</a>`. 

Below is a screenshot after I edited the html to add a list item `<li><a href=""/docs/plugins/cache-assets/language/"">Cache Assets</a></li>` to the ""Plugins"" list (prototyping before a name for the link is settled)

Since the only other link to something `eleventy-cache-assets` plugin related is within [Quick Tip #009—Cache Data Requests](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/cache-api-requests/). I thought it would be best for the `eleventy-cache-assets` docs to be within the ""Plugins"" unordered list as a permalink to the corresponding docs page. 

The [Read More](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/quicktips/cache-api-requests/#read-more) subheading on the quicktips page has a link to [Read more at the eleventy-cache-assets Documentation](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-cache-assets), this link could stay the same and go to the github repo or once the docs are added with the proper menu item permalink (ie ""Cache Assets"") the link could go to the docs page within 11ty-website instead of linking to the external Github repository.

username_0: I would like to request additional documentation on the specific Build Settings required to manually link the RN libraries. I believe there are many Xcode power users among us wanting to add RN without using cocoapods if possible. Linking for third-party libraries usually follows a streamlined process, although can also derive based on the library-vending parties design decisions.

## What is the problem?

Solution for power users is hinted at but not stated.

## How can we address it?

Add the missing documentation part for specific RN libraries to be manually linked 

## Why is it important?

Freedom of choice what dependency managers to use or integrate!

## Who needs this?

iOS developers of all kind (IMO E>junior should be aware of concepts like linking)

## When should this happen (use version numbers if needed)?

Asap would be lovely. I would do it myself, but as I am neither author of the library nor contributor here, I am afraid I would slow the process down unnecessarily (get back to me though if we can change the points above)

username_0: This PR adds a ""Plugins"" section in the sidebar. You can search for plugins on npm and activate them.

Notes:
- presets are disabled
- some syntax plugins are not pushed to the parser (pipeline operator for example)
- for some reason the presets sidebar isn't updating anymore (even if it's updating in the state)
- the API is hosted on `now` for now, we could have it under `some-api.bundle.run` if needed.

Next steps:
- Store the plugins list into the url
- Enable presets

Example:

@haroenv
I'm wondering why my plugin `babel-plugin-transform-scala-lambda` doesn't show up when you search `scala` in the REPL because on the [yarn website it does](https://yarnpkg.com/en/packages?q=babel-plugin%20scala).

Otherwise, your plugin isn't yet shown, because we didn't do the reindex to add the tag on all packages (next Friday at the latest). 

One last thing, just so we don't forget, there needs to be a `<PoweredBy />` component still, you can use the one from React InstantSearch; or make your own link, as long as it says search or powered by Algolia and has a link to algolia.com
<issue_comment>username_1: Hi @username_4,

I will add this tomorrow and also take a look at that :)
<issue_comment>username_1: Hello !

I wasn't able to do this yesterday because the internet on the train was a lie but the logo has been added , let's wait for netifly 🤞
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks @username_1!

What about something like:

<issue_comment>username_1: But aligned right? 😝
<issue_comment>username_4: It can also be at the bottom of the results, providing that it’s not hidden behind a scrollbar

I also added some padding around the checkbox :)

<issue_comment>username_5: Would you be open to add keywords search too?
<issue_comment>username_4: @guiseppeg, not sure what you mean
<issue_comment>username_0: I'm suspecting a bug in the way we merge the old keywords with the one inferred from the name (I can add a test for that later)."

<issue_comment>username_1: Hi, @username_0 !

We have big plans for the data page, so I'm going to add this issue to that project when it gets started next week.

This also makes me think maybe we need some kind of dashboard for power users and volunteers. As we add more context and content to guide other users, we might add more interfaces that would be helpful to the public, but less helpful to the folks who are in this data every day.
<issue_comment>username_0: Still keen on this!

username_0: Hello Processing team,

[Someone noticed](https://twitter.com/username_1/status/1225025743698132992) that your documentation could take advantage of our DocSearch initiative.
So, we went on trying to improve the search and came up with this PR. \o/

DocSearch is crawling the website every 24h, extracting content from every page. Then this content is indexed by Algolia and exposed to the user with a searchbox and its custom dropdown.

You might have already used DocSearch on some popular documentations like Bootstrap, Vue, jQuery, React, Jest, Gitlab, Brew, Heroku, Stripe ...
So far, we are maintaining our crawler for 1500+ docs.

- [DocSearch](https://docsearch.algolia.com/) is fast, it handles typos and highlighting.
- Search results jump directly to the matching part of the page.
- Whenever your markup changes you can [customize the configuration](https://github.com/algolia/docsearch-configs/blob/master/configs/processing.json) on DocSearch repository.
- You'll also have access to a dashboard of the most queried terms, as well as those that yields no results. We found it to be a very good way of knowing how to improve our documentation.
- DocSearch is and will remain FREE

 Changes: 
- load docsearch js and css from cdn
- configure and init docsearch
- add meta for language support
- styling
- clean previous search code

 Screenshots of the change:
