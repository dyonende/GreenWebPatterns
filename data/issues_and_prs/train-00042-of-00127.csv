username_0: A student that is interested in using OONI data as part of her thesis has reached out requesting data analysis support. 

Specifically, she wants to know which countries (in South America and Africa) are blocking social media and news websites and which are not. 

**Data analysis requirements**

* **Countries:** The specific list of countries has been shared in a CSV file (more than 60 countries are listed).

* **Data analysis period:** 01.01.2014 - 31.12.2019

* **OONI Probe test:** Web Connectivity

Based on the above, the student has requested a **CSV file** that presents the anomalies for the tested websites. If we can include the **category codes** too (to more easily identify blocked media), that would probably be helpful too.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_1: The amount of work required to produce this sort of analysis is not feasible and even if we were to produce some output for this, there is a pretty high chance that it will contain false positives.

With the current data analysis tooling we have available it is a huge undertaking to analysis ALL OONI data from 5 years for 60 countries.

This is more like a month long type project and not something which we can realistically provide easily just to community member like this.

I hope that at some point in the future our tooling will get better and we will have the power to make this multi-month project into something which we can easily do.

I have replied to the student telling them this basically.

I am going for the moment to close this issue as wontfix."

username_0: Hey @username_1 

People who have used Frida know how awesome and powerful it can be. But still, I feel like for beginners the documentation is a little complex, and there is no section for windows universal platform (UWP) apps, I would like to update the existing documentation and add coding tutorial. 

If you can help me with starting Frida for UWP apps, it would make things a lot easier. 

I have created a small UWP app for testing which has a single function

{
	greetingOutput->Text = ""Hello, "" + nameInput->Text + ""!"";

<issue_comment>username_0: That would be awesome, thanks.

I'm quite interested in this and very grateful for your help. Is there any slack workspace or any other app where we can discuss more or should I open a PR?.

Also, I'm using c++/cx libraries for writing the UWP app, as I am more comfortable with c++. so I have to build a bridge for c++.

can you give me a heads up on the C++ bridge that would help me better understnad the java and objc bridge.

Thanks
<issue_comment>username_1: Our existing bridges take advantage of JavaScript's being a dynamic language. That means we can use [Proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) objects to lazily generate language bindings on-the-fly without having to do any work up front. It also means you can do `obj.Foo()` without any code generation step as you would need when using C++. The bridge will get a callback where it's looking up `Foo`, and can then go ahead and call into the runtime to find that particular method/field. It accomplishes this using `NativeFunction` and other low-level primitives that Frida's JavaScript APIs expose.

But to the user it's really simple:

```js
Java.perform(() => {
  const Activity = Java.use('android.app.Activity');

  // Allowing you to call static methods on the Activity class:
  Activity.foo();

  // One can also call instance methods, but that requires getting hold of an instance first,
  // which can be accomplished using Java.choose().

  // And you can replace a method implementation:
  Activity.onResume.implementation = function () {
    console.log(""onResume() got called! Let's call the original implementation"");
    this.onResume();
  };
});
```
<issue_comment>username_0: Hey @username_1, thanks for the explanation, I understood the part of lazily generate bindings on-the-fly without having any work to do, and how we can make use of NativeFuntion to make a call to `Obj.Foo()`, this all looks good and I agree on this, but I have a small doubt here that for calling this the `NativeFunction` we have to pass `address` as the first argument, how do find the address of the `Obj.Foo` function? 

let start from a really simple program, that prints a string after every 2 secs.
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <windows.h>

void hello() {
    std::cout << ""Hello Frida!\n"";
}

int main() {
    printf(""The fun address is %p\n"", hello);
    while (true)
    {
        hello();
        Sleep(2000);
    }
    return 0;
}
```
we can hook the function if we have the address, but these are not present in `DebugSymbol` (In your NDC talk you mentioned this for a bit, these are not exported or something?), and we can't get the address of this function/variables. then how the `NativeFunction` will be called? 

manually I can get the base address and add the offset or from the `printf(""The fun address is %p\n"", hello);` I can directly use, Can you tell how this can be achived inorder to use `NativeFunciton`.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 That is what the .NET runtime (VM) knows and the bridge is in charge of querying it so it can instantiate a `NativeFunction` with the correct address and signature.
<issue_comment>username_0: Hey @username_1, 

So far I have written some hacky code just to get more comfortable with the notion of the bridge, I am able to do querying for the functions but when I am invoking them, getting a memory access error,  `Error: access violation accessing 0x6c6c6568`,  

I am enumerating over exports and registering them so that a user can do something like create a new instance and in this direction 
```js 
var query = QueryModule.find(Classname)
```
and user can use this query to do stuff like 
```js
// to create a new object 
var queryObj = query.create(...args_list);

// to get properties  
console.log(queryObj.some_property);

// to replace the implementation of a method
query.method.replace = () {
    cosole.log(""replace with new"")
}
```
The idea here is to attach a DLL which has helper functions for using STL, like updating a string, reading a std::string etc. and a js Module to project these C++ functions into js.

To reproduce, the small DLL has a function, and js module finds function 
```c
// update string 
extern ""C"" void updateStr(std::string & src, const char* target_val) {
     src = target;
}
```

```js
var strptr = Module.findExportByName('CppBridge.dll', 'updateStr');

var update_str = new NativeFunction(strptr, 'void', ['pointer', 'pointer']);
send(""loaded"");

var str1 = Memory.allocUtf8String(""hello"");
var str2 = Memory.allocUtf8String(""world"");
send(str1)
send(str2)

var r = update_str(str1, str2);
send(r)
send(""string 1 = "" + str1);
send(""string 2 = "" + str2);
```

`Error: access violation accessing 0x6c6c6568`, comes at the function calling line

can you tell me how can I solve this memory?"

username_0: Issue: There are lots of supported shells in conda, and each sources a different script extension in /etc/activate.d and /etc/deactivate.d 

So any feedstock that sets environment variables in only .sh or .bat script will fail if the user is using powershell, fish, zsh, csh etc. 

If this issue is resolved (https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/6820) this may not be necessary, but for now it is a huge pain if one wants to use powershell.
<issue_comment>username_1: Disappointed you forgot xonsh :wink: 

I believe that the plan is to eventually phase these out and a new, general mechanism for activation will be added.  I don't think we shoulkd only add the ones where this is needed."
