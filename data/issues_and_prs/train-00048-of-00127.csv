I have started a bit of work on this however I can't seem to get the site
to acutally run locally. I've followed the steps on in the readme:

*1.* Clone the repository and its submodules:

git clone --recursive git@github.com:yeoman/yeoman.io.gitcd yeoman.io

*2.* Install all modules and needed tool

npm install
gem install bundler

bundle install

However I run grunt serve and I just get a blank page. Am I missing
something? I successfully ran all the steps with not errors... I can just
work on the code-lab part and fix up the screenshots however I can't test
if they look good on the site or anything.

Another side note I will be using Cmder on Windows (with chrome) so the
screenshots will be slightly different than the mac termincal ones that
exist now. Is that acceptable?

Regards,
Seth

username_0: This commit adds support for theme composition and inheritance in Hugo.

With this, it helps thinking about a theme as a set of ordered components:

```toml
theme = [""my-shortcodes"", ""base-theme"", ""hyde""]
```

The theme definition example above in `config.toml` creates a theme with the 3 components with presedence from left to right.

So, Hugo will, for any given file, data entry etc., look first in the project, and then in `my-shortcode`, `base-theme` and lastly `hyde`.

Hugo uses two different algorithms to merge the filesystems, depending on the file type:

* For `i18n` and `data` files, Hugo merges deeply using the translation id and data key inside the files.
* For `static`, `layouts` (templates) and `archetypes` files, these are merged on file level. So the left-most file will be chosen.

username_0: This PR aggregates outstanding PRs into one so that pending PRs will not have overlapping PIDs. New PRs can be made directly to [this PR's branch for future requests](https://github.com/username_0/pidcodes.github.com). However, requests will only be accepted after the project has been [certified by OSHWA](https://certification.oshwa.org/). I don't want to arbitrate whether a project is open enough when we already have an org with a process for that.

Existing PRs will be merged into this PR if they are clearly and openly documented and do not break the site build. Others will be skipped with a note about why below.

Closed source projects are expected to purchase their own VID: https://www.usb.org/getting-vendor-id

Fixes #549

<issue_comment>username_1: hello, can you clarify situation once again. my PR is #516 and you wrote that its merged, but i don't see it on pid.codes web page, so can I start use pid? I just have filled form on OSHWA certification.
<issue_comment>username_0: Hi @username_1, it won't appear on the webpage until this PR or yours is merged by @Arachnid. My intent with this PR was to make it easy for @Arachnid to get caught up and to also ensure there are no conflicts between pending requests. I think it's safe to use the PID because it hasn't conflicted with anyone else. It won't be official until it is actually merged.
<issue_comment>username_0: Ok, #527, #544 and #565 were removed because they use new 0xxx PIDs.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 thanks!"
