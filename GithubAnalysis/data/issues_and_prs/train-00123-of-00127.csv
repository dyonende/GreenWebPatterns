<issue_comment>username_1: That looks like it should “just work” providing the quoting is correct.

@username_0 what output do you get from `kubectl get secret my-secret -o json`? (please redact anything confidential!)
Also, what shell are you using?

/triage needs-information
(possibly /triage support)
<issue_comment>username_0: I get what I expected, i.e. 

```
apiVersion: v1
data:
  key: aGVCbG=====================EU0VyMWM=
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: ""2021-03-05T11:03:25Z""
  labels:
    velero.io/backup-name: test-xxxxxx
    velero.io/restore-name: test-xxxx
  name: xxxx-xxxxxxx-key
  namespace: test-xxxxxxx
  resourceVersion: ""18681715""

  uid: dfa3c277-908b-4320-8ea2-b2a41f6e2dd5
type: Opaque
```
The shell I'm using is cmdr which is just a wrapper for Windows command prompt

I also tried it with a PowerShell prompt which gives yet another different error: 
`error: error parsing template {{range $k,$v := .data}}{{###, template: output:1: unexpected ""#"" in command`

And again with PowerShell issuing a simple `kubectl get secret my-secret -o json` returns the expected base64 encoded secret.
<issue_comment>username_2: Did you find a solution @username_0 ?

I've got the exact same issue, albeit through a different tool: 

Using `kubectl get secrets dev-values --kubeconfig ./.kubeconfig -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf \""%s: \"" $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{\""\\n\""}}{{end}}'` in an npm script yields the same error. (NPM executes the command in windows command line, as well as I know) 

Executing the command on the powershell works flawlessly.
<issue_comment>username_1: This might be a shell quoting issue. Maybe the cheat sheet entry could caution readers that the example uses POSIX shell quoting.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 for my part you are absolutley right, escaping mania:

```
kubectl get secret dev-values --kubeconfig ./.kubeconfig -o go-template='{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf \\\""%s: \\\"" $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{\\\""\\n\\\""}}{{end}}'
```

I had to set `npm config set script-shell powershell` npm to execute in the powershell instead of commandline. 
Then NPM seems to unescape for the first time, then powershell for the second time and then kubectl takes over. :D

For why it does not work in the commandline. IDK, but there are multiple stackoverflows having issues with double and single quotes in cmd.
<issue_comment>username_2: For using commandline you just have to get rid of the single quotes: 
For NPM with Commandline:
```
kubectl get secrets indicarus-dev-values -o go-template=\""{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf \\\""%s: \\\"" $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{\\\""\\n\\\""}}{{end}}\""
```
Directly on commandline:
```cmd
get secrets dev-values  -o go-template=""{{range $k,$v := .data}}{{printf \""%s: \"" $k}}{{if not $v}}{{$v}}{{else}}{{$v | base64decode}}{{end}}{{\""\\n\""}}{{end}}""
```
<issue_comment>username_0: That fixes it. Please update the docs and you can close this issue.<issue_closed>"

So time ago, there was a discount. My rss reader fetched item from feed. This item's id is `http://store.steampowered.com/app/519860/`. Some time later, Steam stopped giving discounts. Ok.

Then, when discount appears again, there will be item in feed. But it will have the same id, and IMHO it won't appear again in my rss reader (at least as new item).

@username_1 as you are bridge maintainer, any comments?
<issue_comment>username_0: Not sure about `Bridge-Request` label. Ignore this label.
<issue_comment>username_1: I see the usecase. My RSS reader doesn't use ids.
At the moment I haven't any solution, if you have feel free to contribute 😉 
I will think about it.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 
I checked what it is possible to do, here my report.

To provide and use an ID we need  a _variable information_ (like a ""sale start date"") from the source or a storage in RSS-Bridge to keep a generated ID in memory. There is neither of them 😂

Then, the possible ways :
- **generate a new id at each call** (generated on the fly) → useless in any case
- **generate the id from the price** (kind of _variable information_) → if a new sale come with the same price, the ID will be the same 
- **generate the id from the current date** (_variable information_)  → each day the sale will the effective your rss reader will be triggered
- **generate the id from the current month + the price** → it's highly unusual for sale to be applied twice a month and if the case come you might have to buy it the first time ^^

In all way the id will not be really uniq (related to a specific sale). 
Then, the better solution seems the last one. BUT it's not elegant and it's a trick for a dedicated case.

@username_2 Any opinion?
<issue_comment>username_2: Unfortunately there is no persistent state in RSS-Bridge with which you could determine if the state changed between calls. From the [JSON data](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/profiles/76561198260599288/wishlistdata?p=0) it looks as if each element under ""subs"" has its own unique ID. Maybe the ID changes for every sale?

Alternatively there seems to be an open Steam API that might be worth looking into: https://steamcommunity.com/dev

This service has a ""Last Change Number"" that looks unique: https://steamdb.info/app/519860/
But I'm not sure where they pull it from (maybe the API above?)<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_3: Is this still relevant? Im thinking we would need to find some unique information for it to produce a ""new"" feed item.
<issue_comment>username_3: Let's have scenario. We have feed with discount (example https://feed.eugenemolotov.ru/?action=display&bridge=Steam&userid=76561198260599288&only_discount=on&format=Atom )

Monitoring
PyPI requires a database migration that necessitates an exclusive lock on a
busy table.

In order to perform this we're going to temporarily place PyPI into
maintenance mode.

**Greetings fellow Ethereans!**

Happy new year! [Our vision with ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/about/) continues to be to create the best portal for Ethereum's growing community, and to serve as the front door to Ethereum for millions of new visitors each month.

## 🔀 Rebrand ""Eth2""

We'll add content resources and update user flows (both on [ethereum.org](https://ethereum.org/en/) and [launchpad.ethereum.org](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/)) to improve the UX for anyone interested in staking, including walkthroughs on how to first set up a staking node on a risk-free testnet.

## ✨ Explain Web3

Global [search volume for “web3” is skyrocketing](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&q=web3) as more newcomers discover this space and want to partake in the user-owned internet. However, many existing results are incomplete summaries or outdated news articles destined to become obsolete. This entropy is unfortunate as many of the emotive and poignant ideas in Ethereum are encompassed within web3, yet there is a lack of curated, understandable information on it.

Given that web3 is a relatively new and evolving nomenclature, we believe it’s vital that any authority providing information on the topic is open-source and translated in many languages, allowing for community contribution and iteration on what web3 means (and what it doesn’t).

## 📲 Increase accessibility

Continuing to improve our website accessibility is key to achieving our vision for our global community. Inline with [our design principles](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/design-principles/), we're investing in making our site universally accessible.

This quarter we'll take steps to audit [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/) and identify actionable improvements to enhance the experience, e.g. for screen readers and for keyboard navigation.

Have specific suggestions? We'd love to hear from you - please [create an issue](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose).

## 🖼 Create new illustrations

You may have noticed that most of our [ethereum.org artwork](https://ethereum.org/en/assets/) has been re-used multiple times across our site 😅. As we continue to launch new resource pages on the website, our appetite for visual art that helps communicate concepts of Ethereum continues to grow. We’re excited to collaborate with more artists from the community to create new illustrations for the website!

## 👩‍🎨 Hire a Product Designer

Our team is growing! [We're hiring a Product Designer](https://ethereum.org/en/about/product-designer/) who will collaborate with our product and engineering team to create slick, fun and functional web products visited by tens of millions of diverse Ethereum users each year. 

We’re progressing with candidate interviews and expect to extend a job offer by the end of the month, so stay tuned for an announcement around this. We’re beyond excited to bring a full-time designer onboard to accelerate our product development.

## 🎓 Redesign the Learn page

There is a lot to learn in the Ethereum ecosystem. Currently [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/) provides an ever-growing list of disconnected pages that users must piece together independently. Our long-lived [""Learn"" page](https://ethereum.org/en/learn/) provides a scattered list of topics without much rhyme or reason behind the sequence or importance of these topics.

We'll redesign this page into a more holistic knowledge base and rework the ""Learn"" site navigation to improve our content hierarchy for users and create more structured pathways to learning Ethereum that visitors can navigate based on their areas of interest and current level of knowledge.

## 💰 Refine the Wallet pages

Wallets are an integral part to Ethereum onboarding and network participation. It's no surprise that a huge amount of traffic goes to [our wallets pages](https://ethereum.org/en/wallets/) (>10% of total pageviews).

Since we've built these pages, we've received a ton of helpful feedback. Among the most prominent is that we present an overwhelming number of choices that makes picking a wallet exhausting for new users. This quarter we'll improve our curation of wallets, add new feature filters to help users compare wallets, and add a few ""editors choice"" to reduce decision fatigue.

[Truncated]

Unfortunately, with rapid growth also came an abundance of scammers trying to steal funds from honest members (check out our [security page](https://ethereum.org/en/security/) for tips on protecting yourself) or spammers shilling their low-quality projects. We have already implemented robust automation to prevent such bad actors from scamming, but we will further explore ways to protect our community in Q1.

Lastly, we aim to add several new [ethereum.org](http://ethereum.org/) guides to our Discord server. These guides are trusted members of the community who help direct new members, answer questions, fight scammers, and help shepherd meaningful conversation.

## 🎨 Ecosystem Support Program (ESP) website redesign

The [ESP initiative](https://esp.ethereum.foundation/en/) within the Ethereum Foundation (formerly known as the Grants Program) continues to be a critical source of funding and support for projects within the Ethereum ecosystem. Our team is giving this website a facelift, revamping the flow of the site to make the process of applying for support clearer and more accessible & streamlining our backend integrations to improve internal operations of this valuable program.

This quarter we’ll launch this new website! [Follow along with our progress](https://github.com/ethereum/esp-website/tree/esp-redesign).

## How does that sound?

We always appreciate feedback on our roadmap! Our guiding principles are based on delivering the most value in the shortest time, so if there's something you think we should work on, please let us know! We welcome ideas and PRs from anyone in the community.

Want to connect in person? Some of our team will be at [ETHDenver](https://www.ethdenver.com/) - reach out to us at [@ethdotorg on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg) if you're around - we'd love to chat with our contributors!

[Learn more about contributing](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/), hit us up on Twitter, or hop in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/CetY6Y4).

Hi all,

The Node Foundation has created an HTML version of the Annual Node.js User Survey report and we'd like to host it here.

We think it makes sense since we will also make the data (PII removed) available for download for others in the community to perform their own analysis. We also have some nice executive summary powerpoint slides we can place here for others to use.

There's one aspect of the report that needs to be updated - we have a click to tweet button under every chart and we'd need to update the URL path in the tweets to match the eventual path of the report here on github.

Our goal is to have the report go live on May 31.

I look forward to everyone's thoughts.

Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 if there's a standalone HTML version of the report, it hopefully shouldn't be too difficult PR it into this repository and get it published on the site.

@username_3 @username_2 @MylesBorins do y'all think we could help @username_0 with this?
<issue_comment>username_0: thanks @username_1 

It's self contained - I have already tested publishing it as a GHP - we had it up in a matter of minutes in a test repo. That gives me confidence it *should* be relatively straightforward.

@username_3 @username_2 @MylesBorins I look forward to your thoughts.

Greg
<issue_comment>username_2: +1 from me.  @username_3 any concerns?
<issue_comment>username_0: great news! thanks all!

Just to confirm, the path with be: https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report

Is that right?

If so, my colleague @alexcontini will update the HTML file with the new path and I will open a PR with all the assets.

Thanks again!

Greg
<issue_comment>username_3: We might need to adjust the HTML a bit to fit into the website design properly, but we can help you with that once you've submitted the PR.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3 awesome - that would be great. Can we keep the page private or unpublished until May 31? 

@alexcontini - can you please go ahead and update the links in the tweet buttons with this path: https://nodejs.org/en/user-survey-report

 Then I'll open the PR. 

Thanks!

Greg
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 What's in the GitHub repo is public. But if @alexcontini prepares everything locally and submits the PR on 31st, we're good.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_2 this is what we did for [Node by Numbers](https://nodesource.com/node-by-numbers) at NodeSource, and it does indeed seem to be the best path.
<issue_comment>username_1: correction: We did routing on sub-paths. So /node-by-numbers and /node-by-numbers/2016
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3 Hi!

On second thought, is it ok if I give you a zip with all the web report assets? 

LMK if that's OK and what's the best way.

Thanks!!
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 I'll have a look at it and get back to you.
<issue_comment>username_0: Sounds good, thanks!<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_0: Hi everyone!! Is it possible to get the GA code added to the survey page/pages? 

thanks again!
