<issue_comment>username_1: I found the fix for this, use the `{{% %}}` syntax for the shortcodes. e.g. 
```
## {{% icon name=""fa-battery-1"" %}} My title with icon 
```
That will cause the shortcodes to be rendered before being passed to the markdown processor (which generates the .TableOfContent variable)
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1's solution works well for icons. But using true shortcodes with separate <style> sections still generates this text in ToC.
<issue_comment>username_3: You want to use the `{{%` delimiter in titles.
<issue_comment>username_4: Is this confirmed to work with Hugo 0.72.0? I'm testing it and the icon shows in the first line of the body of the text, not in the title.
<issue_comment>username_4: This is still happening for me with Hugo 0.73.0.
<issue_comment>username_4: Also happening with Hugo 0.74.3
<issue_comment>username_3: Note that any fix for this issue would be to issue some kind of warning/error instead of the haha... placeholder. The proper tix is what I say above. If you see some other issues related to this, that is something different.
<issue_comment>username_4: I'm using the [Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/), which implements [this shortcode](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/icon.html) to render icons. I copy the code below:
```
{{- if (.Get ""name"") -}}
  {{- $icon := .Get ""name"" -}}
  {{- $pack := or (.Get ""pack"") ""fas"" -}}
  {{- $pack_prefix := $pack -}}
  {{- if in (slice ""fab"" ""fas"" ""far"" ""fal"") $pack -}}
    {{- $pack_prefix = ""fa"" -}}
  {{- end -}}
  {{- $padding_right := (.Get ""padding_right"") | default 1 -}}{{/* Defaulting to 1 prevents no spacing when minimizing HTML. */}}
  <i class=""{{ $pack }} {{ $pack_prefix }}-{{ $icon }} {{with (.Get ""padding_left"")}}pl-{{.}}{{end}} {{with $padding_right}}pr-{{.}}{{end}} {{if ne (.Get ""fixed_width"") ""false""}}fa-fw{{end}}""></i>
{{- end -}}
```
If I use the shortcode with this syntax `{{< >}}` I see the icon on the header but the _HAHAHUGOSHORTCODE_ text on the ToC, like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9049533/88482908-99aaac80-cf64-11ea-922b-0ebc8cb8bd48.png)

If I use the `{{% %}}` syntax then the icon is rendered on the next line below the header, like this:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9049533/88482920-a29b7e00-cf64-11ea-8c84-93288ba8d8e0.png)

I'm also mentioning @gcushen (creator of the [Academic theme]([Academic theme](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/))) just in case.

Thanks for your time!
<issue_comment>username_4: Just wanted to remind this. The proposed solution doesn't work for me as the icon is not rendered on the heading but on the next line below. Maybe it's not a Hugo issue but a Wowchemy issue (related to the above `icon` shortcode). It'd be great if @gcushen could confirm it. Thanks in advance!
<issue_comment>username_4: For anyone curious I got around this by directly including the icons without using any shortcode, just using the `<i class=""fab fa-linux""></i>` syntax (in the case of [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons).
<issue_comment>username_5: I've come across this problem too.

I'll just note that the `{{% %}}` syntax doesn't work if you have `renderer.unsafe = false` and neither does the plain `<i class=""fab fa-linux""></i>` solution for the same reason.

It would be nice to fix the table of contents renderer so ignores shortcodes."

username_0: ### Summary

(I'm adding this request on Paul Frazier's behalf.)

This is related to https://newrelic.atlassian.net/browse/DOC-6173, as well as https://developer.newrelic.com/automate-workflows/5-mins-tag-resources.

Specifically, Paul Frazier thinks it would be a good idea to have a tutorial doc on how to  use APM agent tags and then query, alert, and dashboard on those tags. This could either be one new doc or more than one.

We've already got some pretty good documentation on tagging on our Docs site, but Paul would like a more guided tutorial on this.

### What type of documentation change are you suggesting?

This would be more of a how to, educational guide. 

### Motivation

I think there's a concern that people aren't really getting the full benefit out of tags in New Relic One. This would help raise awareness and help people take advantage of the power of tagging.

### Writing the documentation

Please reach out to Paul Frazier for additional information on this."

username_0: Specify that the struct invariant may be violated when the destructor is called, because the struct may be in its T.init state.
This is necessary since there is no way to avoid destroying a struct variable.
See also Issue #19065, PR #19037.
Note that `moveEmplace` already implicitly assumes that this is the case!
<issue_comment>username_0: The deeper reasoning behind this is that since we allow `t = T.init` in @safe code, this is equivalent to me to admitting that struct variables may at any time either be an initialized struct value or `T.init`. Since struct destructors are called on variables regardless of whether they're properly initialized or not, struct destructors must be able to handle both `T.init` and `T(...)`.
<issue_comment>username_1: I think this sould be done EVEN if there wasn't the case with `.init` values: The last public call checks the same value anyway. thus a check on destructor is waste of computational power.
<issue_comment>username_0: Are you sure this commit is still correct! The diff looks weird.
<issue_comment>username_2: It looks fine to me. Done. Ideally the compiler should insert a unittest to make sure that the destructor hanles the case in `(T.init).~this()`.
<issue_comment>username_0: To copypaste the reasoning from the `Nullable` debate: the problem is that this code becomes impossible:

    struct S {
      Object o;
      invariant (o !is null);
      @disable this();
    }
<issue_comment>username_2: ... so ah, 3 days later ...
<issue_comment>username_2: Should this be merged or closed?
<issue_comment>username_0: Yeah, this can be removed. The change in question was never implemented, and the `union` hack has proven a viable - if exceedingly dirty - workaround."

Making our table components align to the grid would be an enhancement/refactor.

That said, the OOTB AEM permissions do seem to prevent saving of form data to an unexpected place by limiting the permissions of the service user saving the data, but relying on that as the only line of defense and allowing authors to try to put form data in disallowed locations is an incomplete implementation.\r\n\r\nOn top of this all, authorable forms give authors a loaded gun to shoot themselves in the foot with in terms of PII data and regulations like GDPR.  I know there\'s no fool-proof way to programmatically prevent authors from saving private content unknowingly and illegally in AEM, but giving them a Form component in WCM Core that says absolutely nothing about it can only give the impression to authors that whatever they want to do with it must be okay.

username_0: Please correct me if I'm wrong and missing out on some inherent security features of AEM or the Forms Container itself - in fact, I hope I'm dead wrong on this all, because I want to believe this is not a ""smoke and mirrors"" product that we are promising clients but then have to re-implement with custom development for any of them that want to use it.

The Forms Container seems to be a pretty huge security risk waiting to happen for any site that authors use it on.

For starters, content saved from the forms is fully readable to anonymous traffic to the URL
- At best this is ""security by obscurity""
-- In cases where `.1.json` or `.xml` are enabled (they shouldn't be in prod, but I've seen it on non-Bounteous projects) this content can easily be fetched by starting from the known `/content/usergenerated/*` path and drilling down.
- At worst an author chooses a predictable URL that can be guessed OR
- At worst an internal user (either malicious or after being let go by a company) leaks the information to the internet or even keeps for their own purposes

Even if the `/content/usergenerated` path is secured by the dispatcher (which it isn't by standard configs documented by Adobe), the Forms Container does nothing to validate that the author has chosen a path under that URL, so even protecting via the dispatcher is no guarantee.  That said, the OOTB AEM permissions do seem to prevent saving of form data to an unexpected place by limiting the permissions of the service user saving the data, but relying on that as the only line of defense and allowing authors to try to put form data in disallowed locations is an incomplete implementation.

On top of this all, authorable forms give authors a loaded gun to shoot themselves in the foot with in terms of PII data and regulations like GDPR.  I know there's no fool-proof way to programmatically prevent authors from saving private content unknowingly and illegally in AEM, but giving them a Form component in WCM Core that says absolutely nothing about it can only give the impression to authors that whatever they want to do with it must be okay.  This is especially true when Adobe makes claims such as the system being GDPR compliant, because one false move by an unknowing junior author is going to subvert that claim.  At the very least it feels like the component should:
- Have some documentation around it regarding the high risk of untrained authors storing inappropriate data paired with the ease in which it can be done.
- Restrict form components to a special role that indicates ""power user"" or even something along the lines of ""data-privacy-manager"".
- Adding warnings to the authoring dialog to remind authors of the security implications of what they choose to save
- Add warning to the Form Container configured to ""Store"" mode when rendered in Edit mode to remind the author (since they wont be opening the container dialog to add a new field)

I've not even yet checked the other form modes (e.g. Email) to see if they temporally save their data in AEM, creating even further PII/GDPR concerns.

Want to get some thoughts on this all from others in the community.  Again, really hoping I'm just overlooking something and making a bigger deal of this than I really am, because if not I think the form components should be removed until the issues are addressed.
<issue_comment>username_1: what you are referencing to is the old ""foundation forms backend"" implementation, a relic of the old foundation components from the days of geometrixx. the core components currently only provide a new set of HTML components that send or store the data using this old backend. there are plans to replace it (see #56, but i'm not sure how high it is on the priority list).

this old forms backend provides other ways than storing the data in the repository, and i agree that storing the data in the publish instance is a very bad idea and should not be used at all. it's up to the developer who sets it up in which way the data is processed. sending the data per mail may be better when you have full control over the mail server an can ensure it's not sent anywhere unencrypted.

btw, imho a better place for high-level discussions like this is the [mailing list](https://github.com/adobe/aem-core-wcm-components#mailing-list).
<issue_comment>username_0: Interesting - didnt know about the mailing list - maybe I will put this out to there.

<issue_comment>username_2: Hi @username_0,

I think that we'll need to deprecate the storage handler that stores it it `/content/usergenerated`, because this is not recommended anymore. And on the other hand, we'll have to document how to implement a POST handler that sends the data to the customer's marketing automation or CRM tool.

Best,
Gabriel
<issue_comment>username_0: Thank you @username_2 for your quick response.  I agree with the plan forward.
<issue_comment>username_3: Maybe the documentation could show how to implement a POST handler that sends the data to Adobe Campaign as an example? ;-)
<issue_comment>username_4: A proper fix would require adding a new POST option for the form content and providing some support/scaffolding for implementing a POST handler. Most probably, we will need a new version of the Form Container. I'll mark this issue to be tackled when we decide to rework the form components.<issue_closed>

username_0: ### Environment

**Python Version:** 3.9.6

**Nikola Version:** 8.1.3

**Operating System:**  macOS 10.14.6

### Description:
After breaking ghp-import and unsuccessfully trying to reinstall it, I reinstalled an updated version of nikola 8.1.3.

Since then I have two (possibly related) bugs.

* Editing and saving an rst file isn't enough for `nikola build` to do its job.  Now I must first run `nikola clean` then `nikola build`.
* The sidebar directive stopped working. After installing `nikola plugin -i sidebar` and rebuilding, I get the following error.

Thank you for your help, I am really at a loss on what to do.

<issue_comment>username_1: Regarding the `nikola build` issue — it sounds really strange. Can you try the following sequence of commands?

```
nikola build
nikola dumpdb > one.log
vim whatever.rst  # (or use your favorite editor to edit the file in a visible way)
nikola build
nikola dumpdb > two.log
```

If you can still reproduce (i.e. the change is not reflected after the second `nikola build`), please attach `one.log` and `two.log` produced by these commands.

Regarding `sidebar` — please consult the plugin’s README file. You need to make some changes to the `messages` files in your site to make this plugin work.
<issue_comment>username_1: There are two things visible in this log:

1. `sidebar` locale misconfiguration — please fix this first (edit your messages file to include the messages expected [by the sidebar plugin](https://plugins.getnikola.com/v7/sidebar/)
2. dumpdb not working with your specific database type

As an alternative, after fixing the `sidebar` issue, I'd suggest the following way of getting the database between runs:

```
rm .doit.db
nikola build --backend=json
cp .doit.db one.json
vim whatever.rst  # (or use your favorite editor to edit the file in a visible way)
nikola build --backend=json
mv .doit.db two.json
```
<issue_comment>username_0: Chris,
I really appreciate your time, I’ve been interviewing for a new job and I feel bad for not having had the energy to get back to you sooner.

1.  TL;DNR    I uninstalled the sidebar plugin and turned my sidebar-directive into a note-directive to get things working again.

Upon upgrading to nikola 8.1.3 (from 8.1.2) installing it in a virtual environment, my sidebar-directives (.. sidebar::) stopped working.
I thought the sidebar-directive was like a float version of the note-directive.
In my debugging efforts I installed the sidebar plugin (I don’t remember doing this under 8.1.2), but only spawned a new complex stream of errors.  After some sleuthing, I decided that the sidebar-directive was different from the sidebar-plugin (an HTML-sidebar having a table-of-contents-like structure).  I temporarily renamed sidebar directives as notes for debugging.

2. FYI .doit.db was named .doit.db.db
After removing it, the website now builds.
Here is the results of 
nikola build —backend=json
cp .doit.db one.json


vim posts/comparing-distributions.rst
nikola build —backend=json



Good news: nothing is broken
Bad news: .. sidebar:: doesn’t render on the side

I’m hoping for the functionality of the Magic Links sidebar on
https://getnikola.com/handbook.html  or
https://username_0.github.io/posts/comparing-distributions.html

Thanks,
Nick"

username_0: Currently, the only way to specify an image for the logo module is to upload one.  There should be an option to select from already uploaded images or specify an external URL.

<issue_comment>username_2: hi @username_0 

Can you replace the `config/app.php` or comment out [this line](https://github.com/microweber/microweber/blob/6557b3dbef2fd9d38581a6fedf43da4af574d45d/config/app.php#L128)

Also you need to add this file `config/auth.php` from 1.0.8 

let me know if it works
<issue_comment>username_0: Hi @username_2  Thanks for the reply.  I started by cloning the 1.0.8 branch.  I now commented out this line:

    'Illuminate\Routing\ControllerServiceProvider',

in `config\app.php`.  I do have `config\auth.php` in place, as well.  Now I get the following error in the laravel log:

<issue_comment>username_2: hi, can you do a fresh clone of the 1.0.8 branch and after that `composer install` and it should run

then copy your module over the logo module
<issue_comment>username_2: can you  set  `'debug' => true,`

in https://github.com/microweber/microweber/blob/1.0.8/config/app.php#L16 

and paste the error
<issue_comment>username_0: Here's what I get:

<issue_comment>username_2: opps, sorry its from the module i added yesterday, i just pushed a fix  038c1018061ddcb58eeaa151712718c4f31551c8

can you pull and try again
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks, it runs now.  Unfortunately, I can't edit a page - when I click on ""edit"" link, nothing happens.  I can go into live edit mode, but some functionality doesn't work any more.

Logo module as is does not work at all - when I try to add it to a page, nothing happens.  If I replace it with my modified one from 1.0.7, then it work, but it then looses the changes introduced in 1.0.8.

The only file I changed in the logo module has not changed from 1.0.7, therefore I submitted a pull request with 1.0.8 as it was at the time of my pull and containing that file.  I can't quite test whether these changes will work correctly on 1.0.8 though.
<issue_comment>username_2: oops i forgot to mention  you will need make `compile_assets` to `false` in `config/microewer.php` in order to load the new JS
<issue_comment>username_0: That didn't help :(  Same results - logo not showing and clicking 'edit' on a page does nothing.  Checking further, I see a 500 error in the console:

POST to `/modules` resulting in 500 error (called from apijs.js) - but I don't see any errors in the server error log.  Here's the stack trace of the javascript call:

<issue_comment>username_2: really strange, 

can you try to make new install on new db
<issue_comment>username_0: Ok, will do tomorrow and let you know.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Just tried with a clean clone of 1.0.8 and a clean empty database - same result.  Logo module cannot be added to a page. A spinner is shown for a second - then disappears.  Nothing in the logs or in the browser console.
<issue_comment>username_2: hi @username_0 

i merged your commit

its working now

<issue_comment>username_0: Great stuff! Glad to help."
