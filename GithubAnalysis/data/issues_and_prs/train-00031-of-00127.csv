username_0: **Note: I would be willing to implement this if others think it is valuable**

In working with another generator, I needed a function that didn't exist in the funcMap, and adding it required a PR to the generator.  It occurred to me that it would be very easy to implement a plugin system to allow users to implement their own functions in the funcMap.

Here's my suggestion - plugins are very simple executables that follow this pattern:

If a plugin executable is run with no arguments, it should output to stdout a newline delimited list of function names.  Hugo would run all the plugins[1] at startup and keep a reference of which plugin produced which function name, for when they're called from a template.

When a template calls one of the plugin's functions, the plugin executable is run with with the function name as an argument, and any further arguments are sent as a json array to the plugin's stdin[2].  The result of the program should be json formatted and written to stdout.  If an error is encountered, the executable should exit with a non-zero exit code, and write any error text to stderr.

Bam, now any user can create a plugin in any language they want to extend the functionality of Hugo to support any function they want.

[1] How plugins are discovered by Hugo is left to the developer.  I don't really care if it's a magic directory or specially named executables in the $PATH or whatever.

[2]  We do this to avoid OS character limits on executable arguments.
<issue_comment>username_1: It would be a very powerful feature for users to be able to extend the funcMap with custom functions. 

But from the POV of a theme maintainer I would be facing the following problems:

**Plugin distribution:** Most themes are publicly accessible as a Git repository which users should only have to clone in order to use it. As themes should work out of the box it would be necessary to track executables in a CVS as well unless there is some dead simple package manager.

Furthermore, executables are mostly platform dependent. Writing a plugin in Go isn't hard but I would have to provide executables for all major platforms (incl. 32 and 64 bit versions). This would create even more bloat.

**Versioning:** Plugins can change over the time, e.g. through the addition of new features or bug fixes. Sometimes a piece of software can change it's behavior which might cause errors. This makes it harder to detect errors because you can say plugin xx with version 1.xxx is not compatible with the current state of the theme.

Of course, if it's a script (python or otherwise) it could be included with the theme, but that does then require that the host have python installed, which is a problem for Windows users.

username_0: Is startupProbe not available on windows container? If that is the case could it be explicitly stated on that page (issue subject)?

```
<issue_comment>username_1: Hello, bro ~
The source code does not distinguish between windows.
And there is no big difference between LivenessProbe and StartupProbe implementation, so I don't think it's not supported by windows container, you can provide a rough deployment config(YAML) as a reference?

username_0: But actually, if you do that, apt will download roughly 5GB of files and install stuff that has nothing to do with kicad, like “Claws Mail”. They were more than 3000 packages, IIRC.

It also installs what seems to be every electronics application known to man.

So, probably it would be a good idea to NOT suggest to do that, and just install kicad, kicad-library and kicad-doc packages? (or whatever is considered a full installation, it's the first time that i attempt to install kicad)

Regards
<issue_comment>username_1: What was the exact output that it proposed? I tried this earlier today and only got new kicad stuff. Maybe you mistyped something?
<issue_comment>username_0: I have a saved apt history.log file. Also, the OS i'm running is a Lubuntu 18.04.2 LTS
The logged command was this:

<issue_comment>username_0: Maybe the fact that i had previously installed the kicad package from the ubuntu repositories had something to do with that? I don't remember if i uninstalled it first, for some reason i don't see that in the log.
<issue_comment>username_2: I agree, it's not a good idea to suggest a user such a command line command! There is strong reason why install-suggests is never be turn on in any Debian based distribution. It would be better if users get a better explanation what packages they need to install for what reason. Never suggest new users which probably doesn't really know what they are doing on the CLI such an installation option.
<issue_comment>username_1: Maybe it is better to just have all the kicad packages listed explitcitly in the command
<issue_comment>username_0: After cleaning that mess with the help of the saved log, i reinstalled by simply running:

apt install kicad

So far, so good. I didn't needed to install anything else yet. I went thru the tutorial. Great software. I was using an old EAGLE version before, and this looks so much better already!
<issue_comment>username_3: I came here to raise a new issue on the very same thing!

Fresh install of PopOS 18.04 LTS.

`sudo apt install --install-suggests kicad` 
installs over 3000 packages, including such this as BIND DNS server, java and go compilers, ....

`sudo apt install kicad` by itself actually installs the templates, footprints, symbols etc.

Suggest the documentation for ubuntu be updated to remove the --install-suggests.
<issue_comment>username_4: I went ahead with downloading the 6GB+ of archives last night as suggested (on a 700kB/s line), causing my PC to become cluttered with a huge list of unnecessary software. A few of the packages brought up configuration options I knew nothing about - a possible security risk. I'm going to wipe my disk and reinstall as a result. Please do replace ""sudo apt install --install-suggests kicad"" at [http://kicad-pcb.org/download/ubuntu/](http://kicad-pcb.org/download/ubuntu/).

![kicad install on lubuntu](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35882530/65846284-69ae6f00-e37c-11e9-9af9-f1fa43707ff0.png)

Steps to replicate:
1. Install or try [Lubuntu 18.04 LTS](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/releases/18.04/release/lubuntu-18.04.3-desktop-amd64.iso).
2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get upgrade
4. sudo add-apt-repository --yes ppa:js-reynaud/kicad-5.1
5. sudo apt update
6. sudo apt install --install-suggests kicad
<issue_comment>username_5: The install-suggests stuff was added with commit https://github.com/KiCad/kicad-website/commit/5a28846a0d977b3a49d2d08895fa5758f4a2510d

There sadly is no pull request associated with it meaning there also is no discussion that would explain why this was added (possibly the discussion is somewhere in the mailing list)

For some users, `hugo clean` would ""feel"" IMO safer than `rm -rf {argument}`, for two reasons:
1. It would be an official Hugo command;
2. It would avoid some users' uncomfortable feeling (observable above) regarding possibly deleting the wrong files through their use of the ""powerful and dangerous"" command `rm -rf {argument}`.

Later, IMO Hugo could provide an option `--keep-static` to speed cleaning (and rendering) when users know their static files haven't changed. This option might apply to `hugo clean` and `hugo`.

tl;dr

Hugo's evangelistic interest would be served by helping some users with their command line `rm -rf {argument}` discomfort, if this help is merely a tiny addition to the Hugo codebase, by means of adding IMO a `hugo clean` command.
<issue_comment>username_1: @acnebs The point is, as I understand it, that the writing of the `rm -rf` command itself is handled by the user, rather than Hugo. This means that if the command breaks, for whatever reason, and deletes more than it should, it's obviously 100% the fault of the user, and not a bug in Hugo which is deleting peoples sites, or worse yet, their entire disk. There are plenty of valid codepaths which would look completely fine, pass code review, be shipped, and then result in someone nuking their entire OS.

username_0: Hi,

Some very important problems can be solved by gaining access to the RESULTANT (Rendered) HTML.
This means that the page is loaded, and javascript is executed, THEN the HTML result is returned.

There is a way to do this.
It is based around creating a PhantomJS (http://phantomjs.org/) bridge.

There are problems deploying this on shared server environments or any method that does not allow shell+compile access.

There are a couple of solutions I am toying with.

ONE:
Create a Micro-Appliance.
This can be done by setting up a beaglebone with access via dynamic domain name to act as a PhantomJS bridge.  This allows you to deploy these yourself to friends and family etc.
Beaglebones are between $35 and $65 depending on which flavor you get.  With case and power supply add another $15 per unit.  This is a one time charge if you have people volunteering bandwidth and power.

TWO:
Create a Cloud Deploy Image.
This can also be done via dynamic cloud spinups (such as on Amazon AWS).
This is easier but more costly over time.

Automated proxy list maintenance can be included on these also, to move this coding/overhead into the appliance, preventing the need to set up CRON for this task with this rss-bridge app.
