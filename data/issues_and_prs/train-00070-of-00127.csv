username_0: ## Why Snacks?

The night before was a party. If the attendees don't need a snack now, they must have some other secret sauce to get their bodies back up to speed. But many rely on a sponsor to help out and prevent a low blood sugar by providing quick energy refilling snacks in the form of sweets, baked goods and candy. Keep those hard working brains happy - either by choosing yourself what to get or just leave it up to us to find the right sugar-bombs!

## How does it work?

Last year we asked some food companies for offers and had the sponsor confirm that amount up front. Once the food was delivered on the day the sponsor pulled out the credit card and made all attendees happy by enabling them to making the blood sugar level catch up.
<issue_comment>username_1: Hey Marco,
we are a Start-Up from Augsburg and want to ensure the blood sugar supply for the attendees of the JSCraftCamp.

<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 
Thanks! Beginners will need simple wallet as you say. They don't need complicated features. 
Your thought about Japanese currency symbol is almost correct.
""ä¸‡"" means ten thousands. ""å††"" means Yen and this is Japanese currency symbol.
10,000 Yen and 100,000 Yen are expressed in Japanese as follows.
ã€€10,000 Yen = 1ä¸‡å††
ã€€100,000 Yen = 10ä¸‡å††
<issue_comment>username_0: Good news, we're getting professional design work done to improve the wallet, which will start next week.

While that's being done, I'm going to set up some ElectrumX servers and put them behind a load balancer, since right now everything is running off of just one ElectrumX server.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 Do you plan to add the strings on Transifex? What's a preferred way to submit translated strings? A PR to `src/lang/`?
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Yeah, it will be added to Transifex.

For now it's easier to do it as a PR, but keep in mind that although 80% of the strings will stay the same, there will be some change in the next week of parts of the text, so it's better to wait after that, so the text can be translated correctly all at once.

username_0: I have a ""bare metal"" Debian 11 server and install k8s with kubeadm.

I follow this guide: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/

The install with `kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=192.168.0.0/16` fails:

```text
[wait-control-plane] Waiting for the kubelet to boot up the control plane as static Pods from directory ""/etc/kubernetes/manifests"". This can take up to 4m0s
[kubelet-check] Initial timeout of 40s passed.

	Unfortunately, an error has occurred:
		timed out waiting for the condition

	This error is likely caused by:
		- The kubelet is not running
		- The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)

	If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
		- 'systemctl status kubelet'
		- 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'

	Additionally, a control plane component may have crashed or exited when started by the container runtime.
	To troubleshoot, list all containers using your preferred container runtimes CLI.

	Here is one example how you may list all Kubernetes containers running in cri-o/containerd using crictl:
		- 'crictl --runtime-endpoint /run/containerd/containerd.sock ps -a | grep kube | grep -v pause'
		Once you have found the failing container, you can inspect its logs with:
		- 'crictl --runtime-endpoint /run/containerd/containerd.sock logs CONTAINERID'

error execution phase wait-control-plane: couldn't initialize a Kubernetes cluster
To see the stack trace of this error execute with --v=5 or higher
```

Looking at containerd logs shows this: `error=""failed to create containerd container: get apparmor_parser version: exec: \""apparmor_parser\"": executable file not found in $PATH""`

Installing apparmor `apt install apparmor` fixes it and the installation works.

IMO this dependency should be added at the installation instructions. Somehere here: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/create-cluster-kubeadm/

Maybe containerd changed.

<issue_comment>username_2: response here:
https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/106974#issuecomment-995128016

the summary is that this is a problem (missing dependency) in the containerd packages, not the k8s packages.
please report this to containerd.

the docs in the k8s website can be updated if needed (e.g. switching to a different repo from the one from docker for containerd), but i don't think we need to mention the apparmor CLI explicitly.
