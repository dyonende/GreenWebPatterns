username_0: [As discussed on the Forum](https://discuss.okfn.org/t/finding-data-packages/4207
) the Frictionless Data site does not help people find where frictionless data has been published.

We should make a page the points to repositories and platforms that support uploading and downloading frictionless data.

username_0: ## Feature Request

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
While the style system is extremely powerful, we are encountering problems with core component adoption because authors cannot select background images.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
As an author, I need to be able to select a background image on more components than just the teaser component.

As a template author, I need to be able to enable/disable styles on components that include author-selectable background images.

As a front-end developer, I need to be able design parts of my page where an author can select a background image from Assets.

As an AEM developer, I need an out-of-the box solution for author-selectable background images.

**Are there alternatives?**
One solution would be to make the background image dialog from the teaser component available to the other components as an option controlled by template authors. This might be the quickest way to get the feature out to the community.

Another solution would be to include a background image dialog on the upcoming container component. Be sure to let template authors control whether or not to allow authors to add a background image. If this alternative is chosen, please move the container component up in the priority list. (The container component sounds really helpful!)

(you can eliminate the parentheses by just linking to repositories.)

So, you see, I still got it wrong, but I think I got it right in the end.

RTFM is the the right advice for me, but you have the power to turn the language reference into something that will click with speed learner/readers and awesome noobs (comme moi ).

Nobody would ever learn PHP is they were sent to the docs first.

not yet communicated or published under coronawarn.app

## Describe the issue
The following behaviour could be validated for some Android devices: 
- Start the CWA
- Select the menu option ""Einstellungen"" and then click on the menu item ""Priorisierte Hintergrundaktivität""
- Activate the slidebar ""Priorisierte Hintergrundaktivität""
- The battery optimization of the CWA task is not turned off on OS level

Thus, the settings within the app are inconsistent with device settings

Known workaround: restart of the device.

## Suggested change
Pls. create a FA-entry for Android users to point out this behaviour.

username_0: **Check_MK:**

Check_MK is an extension to the Nagios monitoring system that allows creating rule-based configuration using Python and offloading work from the Nagios core to make it scale better, allowing more systems to be monitored from a single Nagios server. It comes with a set of system checks, a mod_python and JavaScript based web user interface, and a module that allows fast access to the Nagios core. On top of Nagios it also adds additional features

<issue_comment>username_2: Hey @username_1,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. The problem wouldn't be in your push code. It's possible our service worker is being overridden by another service worker that's not able to handle the incoming event which is why Chrome shows a forced message instead. Could you please provide the public URL to your site so that we can investigate the issue more? More importantly, please also let us know if you're using any third-party push providers in addition to ours, or if your site installs a service worker.
<issue_comment>username_2: Hey @username_1,

Our service workers `OneSignalSDKWorker.js` and `OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js` aggressively overwrite other service workers that are registered with the topmost (site root) service worker scope; would it be possible to import your other service workers into our service worker alternatively?

So for example, currently the contents contents of both `OneSignalSDKWorker.js` and `OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js` are the following:

```js
importScripts('https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/OneSignalSDK.js');
```

Could you try to modify both the contents of `OneSignalSDKWorker.js` and `OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js` to import your other service worker files like so?

```js
importScripts('https://site.com/my-other-service-worker.js');
importScripts('https://cdn.onesignal.com/sdks/OneSignalSDK.js');
```
We recommend the above approach instead of importing our service worker into another file because our web SDK kicks out other workers that are registered on the root scope and replaces it with our files.

Please note that all of this only applies if you're trying to register service workers to the root scope 'https://site.com/other-worker.js'. If you're trying to register a service worker only under a specific sub-directory 'https://site.com/some-subdirectory/other-worker.js', that service worker should not be kicked out (though I could be wrong we haven't really tested that).

<issue_comment>username_2: can occur:

- No messages to fetch from OneSignal
  - (Potential issue) If notifications are queued slower than they are sent, clients will not have any messages to retrieve when they get the push signal.
- A third-party service worker is running, which will still receive the push event, but will not know what to do. This is a likely case described in the second comment of this thread.

- Internet connection fails when the notification is being retrieved, or possibly some ultra power saving  modes on some devices will let the GCM signal through, but Chrome won't be able to make normal network requests to our server to retrieve the notification due to the ultra power saving mode
<issue_comment>username_3: I have this issue (""This site has been upgraded in the backgrou.."") too.

I have a service worker for a Web App Install Banner, as specified at https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/app-install-banners/

The Web App Install Banner calls for the following JS code output by my website to the browser ...
`<script>
// https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/engage-and-retain/app-install-banners/
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  window.addEventListener('load', function() {
    navigator.serviceWorker.register('/service-worker.js', {scope: '/'}).then(function(registration) {
      // Registration was successful
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);
    }).catch(function(err) {
      // registration failed :(
      console.log('ServiceWorker registration failed: ', err);
    });
  });
}
</script>`

How would I modify the above for usage with OneSignal, considering the comment above about OneSignal aggressively overwriting others, and editing the OneSignal[...].js to import.
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_2 I tried your advice coz I have a service worker and it has not fixed my problem updating both the files:

Could you try to modify both the contents of OneSignalSDKWorker.js and OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js to import your other service worker files like so?

```
importScripts('https://site.com/my-other-service-worker.js');

username_0: **Actual Behaviour**

Website is not optimized as much as it could be and there are coding errors and warnings etc.  

**Expected Behaviour**

Google Lighthouse scores are not always the same on each run and device etc.

All  the `circles` should be as close to `100` as possible.  Most modern best practice sites are all in the `green` above 90% range on all 4 stats.

An additional PR for the 5th circle for PWA would be really nice in future.  GatsbyJS is a new modern framework that builds full `green machine` for 5 circles on Google Lighthouse.

A progressive web application is a type of application software delivered through the web, built using common web technologies including HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It is intended to work on any platform that uses a standards-compliant browser, including both desktop and mobile devices.

Official -> ""Lighthouse is an open-source, automated tool for improving the quality of web pages. You can run it against any web page, public or requiring authentication. It has audits for performance, accessibility, progressive web apps, SEO and more.

You can run Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, from the command line, or as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL to audit, it runs a series of audits against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did. From there, use the failing audits as indicators on how to improve the page. Each audit has a reference doc explaining why the audit is important, as well as how to fix it.

You can also use Lighthouse CI to prevent regressions on your sites.""

**Steps to reproduce it**

Use Google Chrome desktop browser and open the menu -> View -> Developer 
Use the Chrome devtools to reproduce the Google Lighthouse report.

I am happy to work on this issue but don't mind if someone else does.

I report here first for discussion 👍
<issue_comment>username_1: Are we going to use GatsbyJS? @username_2
<issue_comment>username_2: 🤔 No, won't change to another framework currently.
<issue_comment>username_0: I was just giving GatsbyJS as an example framework that did all 5 `circles` green or above 90% score.

PWA can be done with lots of tech like even Google libraries.  I even like the Google libraries better 👍 

I think GatsbyJS is good but more `locked in` whereas Google tools seem more standard and there are lots more Google tools too.  Google is a huge company compared to Gatsby etc.

Chrome DevTools, Lighthouse, Puppeteer, Workbox, Polymer, Angular and the PageSpeed Module are the main web tools from Google.

The first two you need know well and use are Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse.  There are similar Devtools in other browsers like Firefox, Safari and Opera.

The next main ones are Puppeteer, Workbox, Polymer.  

Puppeteer is a Node library which provides a high-level API to control headless Chrome over the DevTools Protocol. It can also be configured to use full (non-headless) Chrome or Chromium. 

Workbox is a set of service worker libraries and the Polymer Project helps you deliver amazing user experiences by unlocking the full potential of the web platform. 

Polymer makes the most of Web Components, a powerful new platform feature for extending HTML and componentizing your apps, allowing you to build cutting-edge Progressive Web Apps that load quickly, respond instantly and work from anywhere.

Angular and the PageSpeed Module are the last two.  I've use some Angular it's a good framework but not needed for a PWA. The PageSpeed modules are open-source server modules that optimize your site automatically.

<issue_comment>username_2: Big thanks to @username_0 for those information!
<issue_comment>username_3: Thats a nice practice to be done, thank you for this info :smile:
<issue_comment>username_2: Hi @username_3, could you take this or guide other contributors?
<issue_comment>username_3: yes, i will definitely look in to this, after i will be done by those test refactoring, and if i found this easy i will guide other contributors too
Thank you
<issue_comment>username_2: ok!
<issue_comment>username_3: BTW @username_0 do you think we should go for PWA?"

username_0: ### Describe the bug
When typing 'drugs' into the search bar, the results show there are 4 pages. If the 4th page is clicked, it displays the No Results page. If the 3rd page is clicked, then it appropriately no longer displays a 4th page option.

### To Reproduce
URL: https://datacommons.org/search?q=drugs
Browser: Chrome

Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Go to https://datacommons.org/search?q=drugs
2. Click on '4' at the bottom of page to get the No Search Results page
3. Re enter 'drugs' into search bar
4. Click on '3' at bottom of page, notice that '4' is not longer an option

### Expected behavior
The first page after submitting a search should not display a 4th page if there are no results on the fourth page. The 3rd page is properly not showing the 4th page as an option

### Screenshots
first page after submitting search: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/u4jhxiqraos
no results page after clicking page '4': https://screenshot.googleplex.com/2ezpYD5HsVN
third page does not display a 4th page option: https://screenshot.googleplex.com/8TZrH6Geuyd

### Additional Context
The second page in the search results also displays a 4th page option.
<issue_comment>username_0: Recently tried searching 'drug' and the 4th page had a result instead of displaying the No Results page. 
The problem still exists when searching 'drugs'.
<issue_comment>username_1: Not reproducible any more. The search is powered by custom search and this could be due to inconsistent paging from the indexing.<issue_closed>"
