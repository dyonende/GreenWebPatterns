If you are an agency building websites or other integrations, note that we don\'t grant permissions to clients created for one-off projects. If you are interested in building a product, platform, or widget that will be used as a service across multiple projects, then you may submit a single client_id that you can use across multiple projects.\r\n\r\nTo display content for a personal website.** If you are a developer and you want to showcase Instagram content on a website, then you do not need to submit your app for review**.

We actually created an app and we were able to have our use case validated (it's a bit complex, you actually need to explain them carefully how your use case fit into their new rules). We only managed to get the most basic scope though (it allows people to generate token and retrieve their own images).\r\n\r\nPixelUnion also does Shopify themes and they run into the exact same issue as us, and went through the exact same approval process and, as far as I know, they were also approved like us. This means that you can generate access tokens through their tool. Because they have an approved app, you'll have the 5000 / hour rates limit :).\r\n\r\nObviously, it would be better to have your own app approved as if PixelUnion ever shut down and close their Instagram developer your tokens will be revoke, but I don't see them shutting down anytime soon so I'd suppose you're good to go :).\r\n\r\nHope it helps!"", 'title': None, 'type': 'comment'}

So just the usual disclaimer, this is not a guarantee that you\'ll get approved, but I hope some of the things below make sense.\r\n\r\n## 1. Use all the combinations, polish, be patient, never give up\r\n\r\n- This sounds like a cliche, but believe me, Instagram will really test your patience. I actually stopped for two weeks from submitting out of frustration, before I re-submitted my last 2 submissions and got approved the last time.\r\n\r\n- The trick is constantly polishing the 3 combinations you\'re submitting:\r\n\r\ni) Choosing the use case - ""Which use case best describes your Instagram integration?""\r\n\r\nii) Describing the use case - ""How does your app use this permission""\r\n\r\niii) Screencast - ""Video Screencast URL""\r\n\r\n## 2. Choosing the use case issue\r\n\r\n- So one of the most confusing part of the submission is the use case. And up to now I still do not fully understand those that are related to public_content permission. So basically I chose between two permissions to justify my need for public_content:\r\n\r\na) ""My product helps brands and advertisers understand, manage their audience and media rights.""\r\n\r\nb) ""My product helps broadcasters and publishers discover content, get digital rights to media, and share media with proper attribution.""\r\n\r\nAnd I kept choosing (b) when submitting my app but I only got ""basic"" permission approved using it. I submitted so many times using (b) and just kept changing my video screen cast, and API use case paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIt was when in my last two submissions and I chose (a) that I got approved.\r\n\r\n## 3. Describing the use case\r\n\r\n- Another confusing part is Instagram asks you to describe the API use case in section 3 then in section 4 when you choose additional permissions, it asks you to describe it again: ""How does your app use this permission"". Which to me, ""Why? I already described everything in detail in section 3!""\r\n\r\n- I tried a lot of combinations here, I tried Use Case description and public_content description to be completely different, and describe each in detail, but to no avail. Always rejected. In my last two submissions, I actually got tired already of making long paragraphs, so I wrote a new one in full details how I\'ll use the permissions I needed. Including the technical details (like the logic in the program) and just copy-pasted it both in section 3 and 4. Since my basic permission was already approved at this point.\r\n\r\n## 4. Video Screencast\r\n\r\n- I did a lot of revisions in my youtube video and re-submitted several times. I tried a long introduction to say what I said in my use case, did not work. I tried incorporating live video of our events in different brands, did not work.\r\n\r\n- What really worked, I think, was to be straightforward, focus on the use case, and include technical details as well. So what I did was made the introduction very concise, like only few seconds long, and went on with the flow, and as I was describing the flow (logging in to the website, etc), I was explaining as well the programming logic behind the decision related to the API use case of Instagram. Like when it\'s time to integrate with Instagram auth, I\'ll switch to Sublime Text and show them a piece of code where I\'m actually using the IG auth. Same way with public_content permission.\r\n\r\nYou have to convince them that it\'s not a one off project, and your video really satisfies the use case you explained and selected. I also stayed away from discussing about web gallery integration, coz I have a feeling that they automatically reject this kind of app (not 100% sure).\r\n\r\nAnother good chance that you\'re in the right direction is when your rejection message changes. My second to the last submission, the message changed from permissions issue to issue about our brand might mislead people that we are partners with Instagram. So in the final submission, I just removed Instagram mentions from all of our brands (also had to re-do the screencast because of this).\r\n\r\nI actually got teary eyed the morning I checked my Instagram client and got the coveted green button ""Approved"" for public_content instead of the denied button with a vague message why your app was rejected. Instagram doesn\'t even notify you if there are changes in your permission approval, so it\'s a daily anxiety of checking in the developer centre. \r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to check out more about the use case of my app, you may do so, and yes this is a slightly shameless plug as well: it\'s ""Hashtag Circle"". I won\'t post the link as it\'s straightforward what\'s the website, and we\'re on social media as well.\r\n\r\nNow, I don\'t know if all of the above changes really amounted to something or it was just like ""a guy from Instagram was having a good day"" so I got approved. Maybe luck, maybe not. Or maybe they\'re starting to loosen up, haha! But this was my experience, I hope it helps!

It\'s basically a web-scraper in Javascript, and works because IG\'s web endpoints are setting a [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on the response which matches any `Origin` header you send. A couple of thoughts on that:\r\n\r\n- That\'s an interesting/odd policy for something like IG. Ordinarily, a request like this would be blocked - javascript on a website can only request from it\'s own domain (the same-origin policy), or a host which sets that `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to allow the domain. The fact that IG appears to be allowing any origin suggests they\'re deliberately allowing this behaviour. I tested with an origin of ""Blah Blah"" and it worked - it doesn\'t need to even be a domain. Is this intentional? Accidental? Who knows - it\'s definitely not common though. To compare, facebook.com doesn\'t have this policy.\r\n\r\n- The fact that this is undocumented (AFAICT) gives it unknown reliability. If IG\'s CORS policy ever changes, everything relying on this will stop working without warning.\r\n\r\n- The fact that it\'s scraping the returned HTML makes it much less reliable. A scraper must make assumptions about the contents of the page it\'s scraping (for instance, this script relies on the string `window._sharedData = ` appearing in the page exactly. If IG ever change this (even adding or removing a space), this will stop working without warning.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I wouldn\'t rely on this for anything critical in production.

username_0: I'm working on a client project (built on Shopify platform) and am looking to pull in their Instagram posts by user. I have it all setup - but it will not pull in my client's account. When I plug in my personal Instagram account userId & clientId, everything works perfect so I know it's not an issue with how I have it set up. Are there any known security settings that will prevent instafeed from working on a specific account? To note, the account I'm looking to pull in has a very large following.. not sure if that has anything to do with it?

Here's the set-up I have for reference (includes liquid language as used on Shopify, so just ignore that): 

<!-- Instafeed -->
    {% assign instafeed_img = '{{image}}' %}
  	{% assign instafeed_link = '{{link}}' %}
    {% assign instafeed_likes = '{{likes}}' %}
  	{{ 'instafeed.min.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
    <script type=""text/javascript"">

    var userFeed = new Instafeed({
      	target: 'instafeed',
      	get: 'user',
        userId: '260149935',
        clientId: 'xxx',
      	limit: '10',
      	sortBy: 'most-recent',
        resolution: 'standard_resolution',
      template: '<div class=""grid__item large--one-fifth""><a href=""{{ instafeed_link }}"" target=""_blank""><img src=""{{ instafeed_img }}""><span class=""likes""><span class=""icon icon-heart"" aria-hidden=""true""></span>{{ instafeed_likes }}</span></a></div>'
    });
    userFeed.run();
    </script>
<issue_comment>username_0: UPDATE! Not sure why but with my client's account userId & clientId I'm getting an error: ""The access_token provided is invalid"". There's no access_token provided in the script, or course, as it was noted that with the recent version of instafeed this is no longer required. This error does NOT come up when I have my personal Instagram userId & clientId plugged in (and the script works and pulls in my user feed).

Thanks in advance for any insight you can provide on why this is happening & how to fix.
<issue_comment>username_1: I am also having this problem (with plain js). When I create a new Instagram client and provide the CLIENT_ID into instafeed, I get ""The access_token provided is invalid"". When I use a random CLIENT_ID I found on some forum, it works. I have tried with two different CLIENT_IDs I found on some forums and they both work, but none of mine newly created CLIENT_IDs work?
<issue_comment>username_2: This is most likely due to the new API restrictions Instagram rolled out this week: 
http://instagram.com/developer/changelog/

Have either of you tried to submit your new client apps to the review process?
<issue_comment>username_1: That would explain it. I will get the client app reviewed, and report back.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 @username_1 Just a quick update:

I tried creating a new Instagram client ID and received this same error. I'm currently waiting to submit a test application through their review process. I'm hoping they will accept it under the ""share my own content"" use case, but we'll have to see!

Sorry for the inconvenience folks, I wish there was something more I could do :disappointed:
<issue_comment>username_1: Seems we have to wait untill Dec 3, 2015 before they start to accept Permissions Review submissions.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 thanks for looking into it! Would using the access token fix this in the interim?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 If the token was generated before the API restrictions went into place, then it might. The same goes for client IDs.

My current understanding is that all _new_ API credentials (including both access tokens and the client IDs they belong to) are now stuck in sandbox mode until the review process opens up.
<issue_comment>username_3: I'm having the same issue. Token from the old API works without any issues, however the newly generated tokens don't work.

Any suggestions on how to go about solving this?
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_3 I think we just have to wait until Dec 3 when they start to accept Permissions Review submissions.
<issue_comment>username_4: I'm experiencing the same issue as well. Hoping that the Instagram API changes don't make it impossible to continue using the script in this fashion.
<issue_comment>username_5: Ouch, that sounds like a major pain change from Instagram. We were using that for Shopify too, where customers can simply enter their client ID, but I started to receive mails from people saying it does not work.

If we now must explain them that they should submit their app and wait, it will definitely be very annoying. Did anyone try if the access token suffers from the same issue?
<issue_comment>username_5: It seems though that access token retrieved from the Instafeed client (https://instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=467ede5a6b9b48ae8e03f4e2582aeeb3&redirect_uri=http://instafeedjs.com&response_type=token) properly returns an access token that seems to work (at least that's how we recommend our theme customers to get their token and so far I didn't receive any email saying that it does not work). Asking our customers to create a client, asking permissions, justifying permissions, waiting... does not seem possible tbh.

So maybe Instafeed may make sure that their client used to generate those tokens is properly being reviewed so that it can continues generate token in the future?
<issue_comment>username_2: **Update:** I submitted an application for review to Instagram earlier today, and am waiting to hear back.

I did discover that sandboxed clients can still access limited user information (if the user has been invited to the sandbox app), but only through access tokens, and only the last 20 pictures. This in theory would allow Instafeed.js to continue, but severely limits its usefulness :(

Hoping for the best everyone! Please accept my apologies, I wish there was more I could do to change the situation!
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_5 Yeah, that would make sense because that client (the one for the Instafeed.js website) was created long before these restrictions were in place. So its only going to continue working until they enforce the permissions on the legacy clients as well.
<issue_comment>username_2: I'm going to update the title and original post of this thread, so it more accurately reflects the current situation
<issue_comment>username_5: Haha nice to hear, let us know, I hope Instagram will accept your app so I can still route our users to your website to generate an access token. Otherwise, I already feel the pain of hundreds of our theme users filling our support queue with ""Instagram is not working anymore"" :o.
<issue_comment>username_5: Also, in order to avoid you to have also a lot of issues, I think (unfortunately) that you should revert back your documentation to recommend using access token instead of client ID, and re-integrate your link to generate access token (I was unable to find it in your current page).
<issue_comment>username_6: I also ran into this today, and while going through the process I noticed a ""required step"" to get approved is to ""Provide a link to a video screencast showing a working Instagram Login experience in your app, as well as the usage of every permission you are requesting."" and I feel that this is simply not meant for individuals to use.
It seems that Instagram API now only wants to allow Platform developers to continue to use the API, instead of individual websites all implementing the API on their own. Instagram should seriously consider at least allowing the public_content scope to be retrieved without access_token, or it'll screw over every website out there that uses client-side instagram feeds.
<issue_comment>username_7: Agreed with the above post
<issue_comment>username_8: I submitted my app after the new review process went into place. All I want to do is display my images on my wesite. I asked for basic permission but got an Invalid use case issue in the review feedback not sure what that means.
Instafeed is throwing an error for client not approved but for some reason Instagram allowed me to go live. So I'm not really sure whats happening and how to proceed.

Any help is much appreciated.
Thanks
<issue_comment>username_9: I'm a little confused about the access token. Isn't that supposed to be like, a per user per session kind of thing? Is it a security risk to have it in your code?
<issue_comment>username_8: Hey everyone,
Not sure what changed but it's suddenly working again. My issue seems to have fixed itself. I will try and see what changed so I can give you'll some feedback
<issue_comment>username_10: @username_8 when going through the review process, did you have to provide a link to a video screencast (screenshot below)?

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3523279/11756071/58d66e20-a0ab-11e5-8d87-becc9308c394.png)
<issue_comment>username_8: @username_10 I just put in a link to the section showing the implemetation. Didnt really make a video screencast.
<issue_comment>username_10: Thanks for the clarification buddy
<issue_comment>username_11: First off, thank you for a great script! 

As I created my app with Instagram before their new API release, I wanted to be sure my service was uninterrupted. Placed a submission for review and was __denied__. All my site does is pull content from my personal Instagram feed. Curious to see how this will turn out for more instafeed.js users in the days to come. 

For the future, any tips to get a passing submission would be greatly appreciated.
<issue_comment>username_12: Hi there,
I've just started deving up my first new new project with a personal Instagram feed to a website since this API change has been implemented. 

I've always used instafeed and sailed through now this is really irritating with the whole access token being denied. 

Can I please request the final methods to those who managed to getting working? Did you have to take it out of sandbox mode etc? I hate to be pesky but until a clearer documentation I'm a little uncertain how to get a feed for testing and then for public. 

Cheers
<issue_comment>username_13: So you can still access the instagram API if you can get an `access_token`, but you should be using it on the server-side where your `access_token` can't be read, not on the client-side, i.e. you shouldn't use instafeed.js. Sorry, major bummer, I know!

If you have access to server-side code, you can just write your own custom request, but I'm afraid cool tools like instafeed.js that rely on the client-side are not going to be an option moving forward.
<issue_comment>username_12: @username_13 thanks for the clear up. What a bummer!
<issue_comment>username_14: @username_13 Not quite true. It's the `client_secret` which should absolutely never be exposed to clients, not the `access_token`. Access tokens are tied to single users, after all. If the either the server or the client has access to the `access_token`, the only person it can abuse is the user him/herself (who unfortunately granted permission)

Instagram even explicitly provides a means of fetching access tokens from the client: [Client Side (Implicit) Authentication](https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/)

At the end of the day, whether you handle auth on the server or client, you'll still need an Instagram client to fetch that data, e.g. instafeed. instafeed could easily support both the case where it has the access token, and where it doesn't. For the latter it would just need a configurable endpoint which acts as a proxy to Instagram
<issue_comment>username_15: Talking more about @username_14's comment - ""configurable endpoint which acts as a proxy to Instagram"". So if all our app requires is ```public_scope``` (IE a random user's feed), can't we just create an endpoint with someone's ```access_token``` and then return any user's public feed from that endpoint? 

Can someone just build a third party service to do this for ```public_scope``` data? That way we just make an ajax request, and the service returns our publically available data for us. Aka, A PUBLIC API. This really makes no sense that this is closed off.
<issue_comment>username_16: @username_15 I guess the problem with building a ""third party service"" with a single access_token is rate limits. You would have to use caching and obtain multiple access_tokens, i.e. from every developer using the API. And then you would have to get that service approved by Instagram.

The only other option I can think of is using sandboxed mode, with all its limitations, and with the caveat that access_tokens may expire.

For now, I'm considering simply scraping Instagram's website on my server, caching the result for 30 minutes, and hoping it doesn't get blocked. Because that is actually the [public API](https://xkcd.com/1481/) that we want. :wink:
<issue_comment>username_14: @username_15 AFAIK, the API doesn't allow fetching random feeds at all. It only allows fetching the feeds of users who have explicitly given your app permission. I don't think it would be possible to fetch data for multiple users over a single access token. You can: have clients make requests via a server proxy where the server knows how to correlate clients to access tokens, have clients request access tokens from the server proxy and from there on do whatever, or use Instagram's client auth flow and ignore all that but create potential security issues

Sandbox mode doesn't change any of that, all it does is restrict the users from whom you can grab feeds and lowers the rate limit
<issue_comment>username_17: Did anyone get a ""just show my instagram feed on my website"" permission inquiry approved so far?
<issue_comment>username_17: I submitted my ""web app"" for approval yesterday, it is ""just"" a website showing a client's instagram feed and got denied..

![screenshot](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/81358/jing/Screenshot_2015-12-23_08.41.54.png)

Is there _any_ way to get this solved? I am really fed up with Instagram for this new API rules, I *just* want to show a feed on a webpage, nothing else!
<issue_comment>username_16: @username_17 I think you don't need public_content for your use case, basic is enough. However I don't know if that is the only problem.
<issue_comment>username_17: Am I wrong - if I want to fetch somebody elses feed, I thought I would need public_content ?

```
basic - to read a user’s profile info and media (granted by default)
public_content - to read any public profile info and media on a user’s behalf
```

-> https://www.instagram.com/developer/authorization/#alerts

I _could_ ask the client to give me his login credentials once (he is technically not really skilled) to create the token but that is far from ideal..
<issue_comment>username_16: Yes, I thought you would use an access_token from your client. I understand that you want to use a different account, but maybe Instagram doesn't.
<issue_comment>username_18: My app was also denied as being a simple gallery on an ""About Us"" page doesn't fit one of their valid uses cases:
1. to help individuals share their own content with 3rd party apps
2. to help brands and advertisers understand and manage their audience and digital media rights
3. to help broadcasters and publishers discover content, get digital rights to media, and share media with proper attribution

Seems like they don't want anyone creating Instagram galleries on external websites.
<issue_comment>username_17: Anyone successful? Is there really nobody out there trying to set up an instagram gallery web-app?
<issue_comment>username_19: I had a 5 picture feed on a website get rejected for the same ""Invalid Use Case"". The traffic on the site is small enough that I'm going to try and use it in the sandbox mode and see if the rate limit is an issue.
<issue_comment>username_17: The sad part of the whole situation is that a scraper is written in less then 1 hour and this kind of restrictions undermine _any_ good will to use a proper API..
<issue_comment>username_20: I came across the same issue; I just wanted a GET response of the latest posts of a user.
I had to specify the `accessToken` as well as the `clientId`.

All you have to do is enter the URL with the `client_id` from your app and the `redirected_url`:
`https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT-URI&response_type=token`

You'll get the `access_token` at the end of the URL and everything should be working fine.
<issue_comment>username_17: that's all working, but did you get the app reviewed AND approved? It's easy to get it working in sandbox mode, but I did never succeed with the new review process.
<issue_comment>username_20: Wow? We still need to look into that and do the whole process. I'm still using the sandbox version.
But does that means it's currently NOT possible to use Instafeed.js with an approved app?
Will get back here if we I have any news on my side. Thank you, @username_17
<issue_comment>username_5: For now it seems that retrieving the access token from Instafeed still works.

From what I understand, it is actually Instafeed that must manage to make their app to be accepted. If that works, then we can still use Instafeed to get our access token.

But I may be wrong? In all cases, Instagram sucks on this thing...

Envoyé de mon iPhone
<issue_comment>username_17: As far as I understood we all have to get our own access tokens and instafeed is just the tool, so everybody would have to get his own app/website/gallery (with or without using instafeed, does not matter) approved by Instagram.

Or am I wrong?
<issue_comment>username_5: I think you're wrong. It seems that all the apps just to get an access token are rejected by Instagram. But if Instafeed client alone managed to be accepted, then this one will be able to generate access token for our own accounts.

Envoyé de mon iPhone
<issue_comment>username_21: No, every single developer needs an approved app on Instagram for this to work outside of sandbox.
<issue_comment>username_17: Thanks @username_21, just what I suspected (unfortunately).
<issue_comment>username_22: Did someone get an app approved with public_content permission?

Fuck! I dont know what to do anymore..

Thanks
<issue_comment>username_23: Although it sucks, I think it makes sense to a certain degree... As a small business should you really be allowed to parse __all__ public_content and display a hashtag stream on your site because you have decided you own that particular `#insertphrase`? That's what many are doing with tools like this, myself included.

As a sandboxed app you _can_ access _some_ of your own media...
<issue_comment>username_2: Hey everyone! Sorry this issue has drug out for a while. I've been pretty bummed about the new restrictions and felt pretty powerless to change anything.

I did try to create a sample app and submit it through Instagram's review but, like everyone else, it got rejected.

Short of making a dedicated server to maintain tokens and proxy requests for everyone, I'm not sure what do to. Does anyone have contacts at Instagram that I could ask questions to? If so please shoot me an email.

I did get the project to work successfully in sandbox mode, so we could always update instructions to point out how to do that. But would that even be useful to anyone, given the restrictions they have on sandboxes apps?

Feedback would be greatly appreciated!
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_23 I'm not disagreeing with the restrictions, or saying that they aren't logical.

Instagram has tons of incentives to keep users coming back to their 1st party applications, so they can create great browsing experiences, etc.
One way to guarantee that is to restrict 3rd parties that are outside of their control. 

I do think that restricting 3rd parties isn't the _only_ way to accomplish that (Instagram could, and has been, making great experiences while still allowing 3rd parties to exist for a long time), but I can see how they don't stand much to gain much from allowing it.

Regardless of how much sense it makes for Instagram or not, it's disappointing for everyone who relied on Instagram's API for some part of their product/projects.
<issue_comment>username_23: @username_2 my comments only really apply to `public_content` — essentially prohibiting access to one's own content (for individuals or otherwise) is pretty ridiculous
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_23 Yeah, the restrictions really are on the tight side. Even in sandbox mode, you can only access 20 of your most recent pictures, correct?

I'm curious how successful other 3rd parties have been in getting approved. Apps that try to cover other use cases, or do more than just pull in public content.
<issue_comment>username_17: I found a jQuery plugin (commercial) and they state that they got approved (https://elfsight.com/blog/2015/11/no-more-need-in-instagram-client-id-after-november-17-2015/) but as far as I find out they provide a proxy for all their clients that acts as the ""app"" that was approved, so that is not really a solution to the problem. It's interesting that their ""app"" git approved, though since customers can filter and pull all kinds of feeds (all public coontent).

Which does not do anything different than all the people that tried to get new apps approved using instafeed...
<issue_comment>username_16: This is interesting, [the page](https://elfsight.com/service/get-instagram-access-token/) on elfsight where you can get an access_token is public, and the access token you get seems to work for public_content.
To try it out, generate a token and then paste it into this url:

    https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/nofilter/media/recent?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN
<issue_comment>username_17: You are right, it really works for public content, too. I wonder how (and if) Instagram will shut down single access tokens that are connected to this app?
<issue_comment>username_24: So do we have steps to follow so that this app works?  I thought I was going crazy I managed to get a code and then have no idea how to get the access token.?
<issue_comment>username_8: @username_24 You can use the this link http://jelled.com/instagram/access-token to get your access token. I managed to get the app working by passing the client id, userid and the access token to the plugin.
<issue_comment>username_24: @username_8 like this am I doing something wrong?

<script type=""text/javascript"">
    var userFeed = new Instafeed({
        get: 'user',
        userId: '282077628',
		 tagName: 'northwoodvillage',
        clientId: 'c9f21838aae94cfd8d0b4d85e2f2ee73',
        accessToken: '282077628.c9f2183.db4ed3b7f8c04677b392485fa8d371b2'
    });
    userFeed.run();
</script>
<issue_comment>username_8: I suggest you remove your keys. It's not a good idea to post them online. Your code seems ok. If it isn't working check the browser console and see if the API is returning any errors. What is the error you're getting?
<issue_comment>username_24: @username_8 Thank you I got this this worked I had one small thing wrong on my end but i fixed it and it worked great thank you soooo much for your time :)
<issue_comment>username_8: @username_24  You're welcome.Glad you got it working.
<issue_comment>username_25: @username_16 that works for me, super thanks. hope it stays working for a while :)
<issue_comment>username_26: So, correct me if I'm wrong, trying to collate all the info. This means we now have to get every single web based Instagram feed approved by Instagram themselves? We've been waiting 1/2 a day for a response to go live already.

If I'm creating a feed for the client from their own images, where all of the API calls are done in PHP I shouldn't have a problem?

Is there a way to have one cover all app that gets approved to fetch feeds, and then have clients go in and approve access for this app themselves? We can't really afford to be waiting around for approval each time in an agency environment.

Can't say the documentation is particularly well laid out. You'd think for a change like this there would be a quick FAQ put together...
<issue_comment>username_27: Can anyone confirm if I try to approve my application that is currently active through Instagram's API Approval, do they disable the application if it doesn't get approved?
<issue_comment>username_23: @username_27 you will remain in sandbox mode
<issue_comment>username_27: @username_23 What I meant was, if my app currently is functional with legacy mode. (Active until June 2016) Will applying and being denied disable the application or will I still have until June 2016?
<issue_comment>username_28: Does anyone know what will happen to existing access_tokens on apps that go into sandbox mode in June? Will they still have the previous scopes, or be limited to the sandbox restrictions, or will they simply be invalid?
<issue_comment>username_21: As far as i understand it, all apps that don't update will be forced in
sandbox with the scopes that sandbox allows, EG default sandbox no extra
scopes.
<issue_comment>username_23: Right. New apps need to be approved, old ones have until June to get approved. After June if you are not approved you are sandboxed.
<issue_comment>username_28: @username_21 @username_23 right. But I have an app that has thousands of users connected to it, with corresponding issued access_tokens. Only the most recent 10 of those will still work? And with limited sandbox functionality? oi ve.
<issue_comment>username_23: You better make a real fucking nice video then!
<issue_comment>username_26: Looked into this, it seems as if feeds for websites won't be approved; these will remain in sandbox mode and be limited to 500 requests per hour and 20 images. This doesn't sound like much especially for large clients, but if you cache your responses, it's not a problem. 

You will no longer be able to display feeds based on hashtags, only a users own photo's. By getting a user to be a sandbox user, is how you can access their feed without their login information.

Older apps/feeds will need to be updated to use the new code before June or they may stop working.

It's mainly to stop apps hammering instagram's servers for unlimited requests on any hashtag/users they like. I'm not sure instafeed will continue to work, but there are several PHP solutions out there already. They just need to be modified slightly.

Here is an example of how to fetch and cache images using WordPress's 'set_transient'
[WordPress Instagram Gist](https://gist.github.com/username_26/981fc04b9bb2f4efaf34)

The main confusion is because of the fact they have made it sound like every app/feed has to be approved and out of sandbox mode to work, where as the reality is that only fully functioning apps for phones, or a widget plugin really ever need to be.

Here is the relevant piece of information in the dev docs:

""**Here are some examples of scenarios that will not be approved:**

_To use a widget. If you are installing a widget for your website, then you do not need to submit for review. Some widgets may ask you to create a new client id, but you do not need to submit it for review for the widget to work. Your client can remain in sandbox mode and the widget will have access to your last 20 media.

One-off projects. If you are an agency building websites or other integrations, note that we don't grant permissions to clients created for one-off projects. If you are interested in building a product, platform, or widget that will be used as a service across multiple projects, then you may submit a single client_id that you can use across multiple projects.

To display content for a personal website.** If you are a developer and you want to showcase Instagram content on a website, then you do not need to submit your app for review**. By using a client in sandbox mode, you will still be able to access the last 20 media of any sandbox user that grants you permission._""

Hope that helps clear some confusion.
<issue_comment>username_29: Hi all...as a business guy trying to get his first e-commerce site up that simply prints user's Instagram imagery (ie we're not a feed reading app), my developer has now downed tools (rightly) due to his fear about the ""One-off project"" clause...I could understand Instagram having issues with say an ad agency building something for a temporary, time-limited promotion, but does anyone know whether a genuine, bona fide, long term commercial venture would be excluded under this clause too? Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_23: @username_29 your developer needs a sand-boxed app that you need to authorize against your own instagram account. That will give him access to your most recent 20 posts.
<issue_comment>username_29: Hi Rick.
Great - thanks for this...really appreciate the answer!

<issue_comment>username_30: Hello friends,
I want to get permission(From instagram) for **access media of other users and store it in device's gallery**. 
**""Basic"" permission already approved**. But it rejected for public_content. 
**Will i need ""public_content"" permission to access and save public user's media?**
 Because without that permission app works correctly.
And **can i show ad in my app while i create screencast for submit for review?**

I got following rejection:

https://app.box.com/s/wl0j5ymcii3vqs0mxozrhvch54h7kknr


_I repeat, I only need to access **public user's media** and user can **store** that media in his device's gallery._
<issue_comment>username_31: Hi guys,
I'm having the same problem with error message ""The access_token provided is invalid""
I'm using the javascript library were you only put  the username and client_id but I get that error.
I already have the app ready were I got the client id from and I'm ok with using sandbox mode with only the latest 20 items, but it just won't let me.
<issue_comment>username_32: @username_31 
var feed = new Instafeed({
    get:'tagged',
    tagName: 'supreme',
    userId: YOUR_USER_ID,
    accessToken: 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN',
    limit:'100',
});
<issue_comment>username_33: *Please* mention somewhere in the readme that most of the examples no longer work. It is really frustrating to only find this out after an hour of experimenting.
<issue_comment>username_34: Any updates on this or potential work arounds?
<issue_comment>username_34: I see.. And who wants to store an access token client side? Haha
<issue_comment>username_35: @username_34 It's unfortunate, I've just had a hard decision of scrapping a feature in my theme due to Instagram's new policy...
<issue_comment>username_22: Someone with public_content access?
<issue_comment>username_34: @username_22 for sure, if you can get it! I don't see why instagram don't provide the same features as Facebook do for embedding timelines, it's seamless and after all they're one and the same company now... Maybe they're working on it
<issue_comment>username_22: Hi @username_34. Im sure they are working it, but  have many I have a Instagram plugin developed and many users are waiting for the new version and I already tried many times get a app approved with public_content but all the time unsuccessfully. I already produced videos, huge content explaining but no way to get it.

Just want a tip from someone that already get it.

So thanks for your answer. Ill keep working.
<issue_comment>username_30: @username_22,I also keep working on it.  if you find solution, then tell me.
<issue_comment>username_31: @username_32   the extra parameter that I see there is the access token but I don't want to ask for the user permission and authenticate with their account, I just want to show the latest posts in the widget.
<issue_comment>username_36: Hey, 
Also blocked because of those restrictions for new Instagram Client.
I would be glad to know if anyone finds a work around!
<issue_comment>username_22: FUCKKK YEAAAH!!!! I GOT IT!!!!!

Im so happy! If someone wanna the content I included please send me a email!

username_22@gmail.com
<issue_comment>username_22: I just included a video showing how my application works and put a description about my project.

My description wasn`t so detailed but I reckon the guy who check it was in a good day, because many times I tried almost with the same description and wasn`t approved. 

I Re-Submitted a Client that I tried 1 month ago and now showed some checkbox about the objective of my project. 2 hours later the permission basic and public_content was approved.
<issue_comment>username_23: @username_22 I'm curious what you are doing with public content. Is it a public app?
<issue_comment>username_22: @username_23 with public_content permission I have access to hashtag, location and user content of every user at Instagram. Very useful.
<issue_comment>username_23: Sure @username_22 but what are you _doing_ with it? What is the end use? Just curious.
<issue_comment>username_22: WP plugin
<issue_comment>username_37: I've made a simple PHP script that grabs images from a specific user onto your server and updates a customizable HTML file that can be included in your pages. Feel free to use as you wish, and like this comment if you do. ;)
https://gist.github.com/username_37/84c986d2167a77e3bc12
<issue_comment>username_38: So I'm also having the ""access_token invalid"" issue (we're just trying to display our own Instagram feed on our site), and still can't tell from following this whole thread whether a) providing an accessToken parameter in the javascript is supposed to help (doesn't help us, we get a ""this request requires scope-public_content, must re-authorize application"" error instead, or b) if there's some definitive instafeed javascript code example that addresses the Nov 2015 Instagram policy changes. Sorry to be a dope, but I'm really unclear yet how this is supposed to work. Thanks.
<issue_comment>username_39: Can someone please explain the dangers of having the access token exposed in the script? Is there a way to hide it or protect it from being used outside of the domain I want?
<issue_comment>username_36: @username_37  I am not really good at PHP yet. Could you please let me know how to call your script once it is set up with access token and hosted on my server in a ""php"" named directory ? Thanks!
<issue_comment>username_39: @username_36 I guess it's almost impossible, I've researched and people don't provide pratical examples because there's no easy way. Even if you send the key via PHP, you'd have to expose it in order to the script work. 

You should try this PHP Instagram plugin: http://pastebin.com/19gyGkMy

Just paste it in a PHP and call it in your HTML by using <?php include 'PHP FILE HERE.php' ?>
<issue_comment>username_37: @username_36 you can just use `php instagram.php` from the command line (when you're in the same folder as the script). In the cron you can do `0 * * * * php /path/to/instagram.php`.
<issue_comment>username_40: @username_22 
What did you choose from this list?
![a](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/18413319/14450873/5cd61d34-0093-11e6-8963-cd527e1d3766.JPG)
<issue_comment>username_41: Hello Everyone,

My application need all permission from Instagram which is: like, comment, relationship, follower_list, public_content etc.

I am trying to get approve from Instagram since 4 month but no luck yet. can any body help on this. i tried many screen cast many descriptions but each i got rejected.

Thanks
<issue_comment>username_41: @username_22

i choose 1st option every time which you mentioned above.
<issue_comment>username_42: @username_28 Did you happen to sort out what happens to existing tokens after approval? We are in a similar position where we have a large number of existing clients with authorized tokens, and don't want app approval to force all of our tokens to be invalid due to missing required permissions.
<issue_comment>username_28: @username_42 no info, as of yet, but I think the safest route is to assume that without approval your tokens will no longer be valid. Let me know if you hear otherwise or get approval.
<issue_comment>username_43: What about for personal use? I can't get a feed even with ClientId and UserId set to myself. Is this expected?

Sorry very confusing stuff considering the different experiences listed.
<issue_comment>username_42: @username_28 To update: We've gone through approval (we are part of the IG partner program, this was just the best discussion on the web I've found about the changes :) ). Our legacy tokens maintained after being approved, and I believe any new tokens are similarly maintained through June 1st. I do believe that, without approval, our tokens would have been invalidated.

And @username_43 you should be able to access ""self"" for the token owner on a Sandboxed app (assuming that user is either the client owner or an approved sandbox user). Double check that your token is valid.
<issue_comment>username_44: From what I understand, it is actually Instafeed that must manage to make their app to be accepted. If that works, then we can still use Instafeed to get our access token.

![screen shot 2016-05-09 at 11 05 40 am](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8745331/15100989/774fa5be-15d7-11e6-91a0-e3c2154b7143.png)

Does that mean in my user case, if **Instafeed** create an approved app(website) that helps us retrieve our **Access_Token** to be used in conjunction with Instafeed.js, it will be issued by an **Approved app**, therefore we all have the 5000/hour rate using that token?

Does anybody have an answer?
I'm currently abusing my access_token by refreshing my test page locally making requests every 2 seconds..(not sure if the request count as 1 since it's the same IP, or it adds up...). Any suggestion on a better way to test it are welcome.
<issue_comment>username_5: Hi,

Sure, this is a bit confusing so let explain you @username_44 .

Actually, if Instafeed would have its application approved (I don't know if they do), you could indeed generate an access token there.

We are personally doing Shopify themes (like PixelUnion), and Instagram was quite critical for us. We actually created an app and we were able to have our use case validated (it's a bit complex, you actually need to explain them carefully how your use case fit into their new rules). We only managed to get the most basic scope though (it allows people to generate token and retrieve their own images).

PixelUnion also does Shopify themes and they run into the exact same issue as us, and went through the exact same approval process and, as far as I know, they were also approved like us. This means that you can generate access tokens through their tool. Because they have an approved app, you'll have the 5000 / hour rates limit :).

Obviously, it would be better to have your own app approved as if PixelUnion ever shut down and close their Instagram developer your tokens will be revoke, but I don't see them shutting down anytime soon so I'd suppose you're good to go :).

Hope it helps!
<issue_comment>username_44: @username_5 Thanks for the explanation!
Mind linking me to your app? It sure is better having a backup access_token in hand :P
<issue_comment>username_5: Sure: https://maestrooo.com/instagram
<issue_comment>username_45: Using the https://maestrooo.com/instagram accesso token I try to get the public media of a user but it says ""This client has not been approved to access this resource.""

Does anyone knows any app that has access to it.
<issue_comment>username_46: Yeah https://maestrooo.com/instagram didn't work for me either, sadly :(
<issue_comment>username_44: @username_45 @username_46  try http://instagram.pixelunion.net/
<issue_comment>username_45: @username_44 actually I tried with that app before coming to this thread but I got the same error, seems there are not app with public_content scope approved
<issue_comment>username_44: In that case I don't know then. I'm only using them to grab feeds, works fine for me with both of the tokens generated by them.
<issue_comment>username_45: But you are viewing feeds from the same account that generated that  access token right?
<issue_comment>username_44: Yes
<issue_comment>username_47: Hi @username_44 pls test now again I use http://instagram.pixelunion.net/ and just get error same @username_45 .
Who know how to fix it.
<issue_comment>username_48: Seems like there has been an Instagram API update 1st of June?

I had to authorize the access token this way manually to retrieve a public hashtag feed:
https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=...&redirect_uri=...&response_type=token&scope=public_content
(made sure the redirect url matches and then get the access token from the URL and insert it in the new Instafeed-directive in Javascript).

Now it can't find any images though, not yet sure why because the given hashtag actually has images on Instagram..

""Uncaught Error: No images were returned from Instagram""
<issue_comment>username_49: i managed to fix the issue with the link provided above ( http://instagram.pixelunion.net/ )
thanks @username_44 .. 

in order to display images from instagram you need to provide an authorized access key that linked to the same userid you are trying to import it's content. 
now i must ask my customers link their account and provide me with the access token they receive from the link mention above 
looks like i didnt have the accessToken key on my previous code because i managed to bring content without it and now it's mandatory.. 
 if you have any question feel free
<issue_comment>username_44: @username_47, refer to @username_49 's comment above. I've requested an access token again, still works.
""It worked!

Use this token in the appropriate field on your website or blog, and you should have a working Instagram widget....""
<issue_comment>username_50: Hello! What should i do to use instafeed only for showing posts from instagram? I get accessToken, i enter clientId, userId but still get an error:
""error_type"": ""OAuthParameterException"",
""code"": 400,
""error_message"": ""Missing client_id or access_token URL parameter.""
<issue_comment>username_49: @username_50  can you share your code snippets
<issue_comment>username_50: `		init: function()
		{
			var feed = new Instafeed(
			{
				get: 'user',
				userId: USER_ID,
				clientId: CLIENT_ID,
				accessToken: ACCESS_TOKEN,
				limit: this.$container.data('limit') || 6,
				resolution: this.$container.data('resolution') || 'standard_resolution',
				sortBy: 'most-recent',
				after: this.onAfter
			});
			feed.run();
		},`
<issue_comment>username_49: you can remove the clientId, leave the access token only.. 

did you get the access token from the link above ?  if yes, did you logged in with the same user your trying to fetch it's content ?
<issue_comment>username_44: Just a quick summary for people who simply want to grab feed images.



1. You need to (or get your client to) log into the Instagram account which you want to grab feeds from.
2. Visit [http://instagram.pixelunion.net/](url) or [https://maestrooo.com/instagram/](url) (thanks @username_5) 
3. Authorise the apps to generate the access token


---
**Sample code**
```
var feed = new Instafeed({
    get: 'user',
    limit: '20',
    target: document.getElementsByClassName('slick-slider')[0],
    userId: USER_ID,
    resolution:'standard_resolution',
    accessToken: ACCESS_TOKEN,
    template:'<a href={{link}} target=""_blank""><img src={{image}} alt=""""/></a>'
    after: function(){}
});
feed.run();
```
no client_id needed
<issue_comment>username_51: So much thanks for @username_44 I spent last two days for fixing this - this line 

""USER_ID is simply the first few numbers before the dot in your Access Token"" 

Saved my day, I never knew that userId is contained in accessToken, and couldnt find the userId because all the services that providet this were down

Thanks again
<issue_comment>username_52: Any chance I can still get data based on hashtag (not just from my own profile, but from different profiles also), like we previously used to get from instafeed. It stopped after 1st June. Now I am getting this

""Uncaught Error: Error from Instagram: The access_token provided does not match an approved application""

My access token isn't approved and don't think it falls under any use case that they have mentioned in their documentation. This is a big bummer, I am using it for my own site.

I tried generating an access token through PixelUnion. But then its saying this

""Uncaught Error: Error from Instagram: This client has not been approved to access this resource.""

Seems like their app hasn't been approved for that as well. No idea how to go forward with this.
<issue_comment>username_50: No, i was getting it from instagram tutorial
<issue_comment>username_53: I'm having the same issue as @username_52 – I was pulling a group of hashtagged images and now they're not displaying. I generated an `accessToken` from http://instagram.pixelunion.net/ and modified the code to pull only a `get: 'user'` but that's not working for me either.

```
var feed = new Instafeed({
        get: 'user',
        userId: 'xxxxxxxxxx',
        accessToken: 'xxxxxxxxxx.rest-of-access-token',
        resolution: 'standard_resolution',
        limit: 4,
    });
    feed.run();
```

Am I missing anything?
<issue_comment>username_50: @username_49 Thanks, that works for me. I try your variant
<issue_comment>username_48: If the accesstoken is not working, try https://www.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=[CLIENT ID]&redirect_uri=[YOUR REDIRECT URL]&response_type=token&scope=public_content. You should see an authorization dialog.

Now I am curious what happens when the token is correct, still haven't got a working hash feed.
<issue_comment>username_49: @username_52 , i think you are not able to bring these tagged content.
due to the new privacy policy you are able to bring only your own.. this is my assumption

Thanks Instagram for making it so difficult  for us :)
<issue_comment>username_52: @username_49 exactly man, such a pain and no idea how to get them also.
Btw, @username_53 I am able to get my own content with the same code that you mentioned, with the access token generated from pixelunion.

What's the error being shown in the console?
<issue_comment>username_54: Since people don't take the time to read, here is a short info about the **Instagram API changes** which effect all scripts that show feeds on websites.

Most important: Instagram don't allow you and won't to show feed from other users on your site. The only thing you can do, after you got an access token, is to show your own pictures. 

There is no fix and nothing to fix, they made an announcment half a year ago. If you have an app you must request client id, etc. But thats not important here.

**So... just get your access token and insert it to show your own media.**
<issue_comment>username_45: @username_54 I'm aware of that what I'm looking is for an app that has the public_content scope approved so I can bring public info of others users, the 2 apps from above only has the basic scope which is limited to the own user content
<issue_comment>username_52: @username_45 Exactly what I am looking for. Update here if you find any.
<issue_comment>username_54: We’ve updated our Platform Policy to explicitly list the use cases we will support moving forward. These include apps and services that:

-  Help **individuals share their own content** with 3rd party apps, such as apps that let you print your photos and import an Instagram photo as a profile picture.
-  Help **brands and advertisers** understand and manage their audience, develop their content strategy, and get digital rights to media. Established apps in this space may apply for our newly announced Instagram Partner Program.
-  Help **broadcasters and publishers** discover content, get digital rights to media, and share media using web embeds.
<issue_comment>username_55: I just checked my client's website and see that the instafeed section is blank; no longer pulling in the hashtag they wanted.

So, put this in dummy terms for me please. Basically you can no longer pull in a specific hashtag to your website using instafeed? Yes or no.
<issue_comment>username_56: History repeats itself...

Catastrophically awful decision by Instagram, going the Twitter route of requiring ridiculous authorization measures to query _public information_. Nothing is accomplished by this at all except forcing end users to switch to [hacky scrapers](http://jasonmayes.com/projects/twitterApi/) instead of a clean documented API.

Wonder how many more social media companies will elect to go this route before they start learning from the others.
<issue_comment>username_48: @username_56 100% agreed. For the average site, getting some basic Instagram info just became a huge pain. Most of that access is only available for the larger scale sites that make it through the checklist during the submission process.
<issue_comment>username_56: @username_48 The problem is that there is no clear delineation on Instagram's (or Twitter's) side between desktop/mobile native application written that functions as a complete Instagram client replacement allowing people to manage their profile and upload photos, versus a purely client-side JS web page that just wants to display publicly available data and will never need write permissions.

I don't have a solution to this problem, just sick of seeing it happen for no reason.
<issue_comment>username_57: I'm getting error 429, too many requests.

Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 429 ()
<issue_comment>username_58: As a group that used instafeed for a single digital sign in a higher education environment, this is a huge disappointment. I don't see why they couldn't have two tiers of API access. One that does their dog and pony show ""give us a video feed of your product"" and one that is ""okay, you can have access, but you're limited to X queries per hour"". They do that in sandbox, but only for YOUR content. Just boggles. Now, we'll just encourage our students to use a different product that we can actually access. Sure, it's a drop in the bucket for lost users, but it's still lost users. =/
<issue_comment>username_59: Is there a 3rd party application around that is verified and requires the public_content scope? I am just looking around for an access_token. Gave up hope after instagram required a ""screencast"" of the login process while I use command line to take care of that.
<issue_comment>username_60: We recieved the public content. Who want to buy it?
<issue_comment>username_59: @username_60  Merely using your client_id would be preferred
<issue_comment>username_17: @username_60 you are kidding, right?
<issue_comment>username_61: Yeah, just noticed this today. Half of our sites IG-feeds are broken, since we love hashtag feeds.

`accessToken` set properly, getting this:

````
all.js?ver=1.0:5 Uncaught Error: Error from Instagram: This request requires scope=public_content, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=public_content to be granted this permissions.
````

And public_content can't be applied any longer:

````
I want to display hashtag content and public content on my website. - This use case is not supported. We do not approve the public_content permission for one-off projects such as displaying hashtag based content on your website. As alternative solution, you can show your own Instagram content, or find a company that offers this type of service (content discover, moderation, and display).
````

Really bad call, Instagram. Forced to switch to user feed.
<issue_comment>username_62: @xxrobot ah, that's the part I was missing. I am only looking to access hashtags so this ""hack"" isn't what I thought it was. I thought it was a temporary around the restriction which is why I was assuming it would soon not work.
<issue_comment>username_63: This worked for me:

https://gist.github.com/mojaray2k/b502d75dd7a9fa277876
<issue_comment>username_64: @username_63 I've tried this out but get following error:

`main.min.js:3 Uncaught Error: Error from Instagram: This request requires scope=public_content, but this access token is not authorized with this scope. The user must re-authorize your application with scope=public_content to be granted this permissions.`
<issue_comment>username_65: @username_64 
worked for me: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36471505/instafeed-instagram-this-user-does-not-exist
`&scope=public_content`
<issue_comment>username_66: @username_5 hi, can you send the link of the screencast video for submission? 

thank you
<issue_comment>username_67: @username_64,

@username_65 is correct with the `&scope=public_content` that was the key for me.

It needs to be added when you generate your access-token, then you can read any user feed.  You _do not_ need to invite the user to be a sandbox user for your new app.  You need to authorize yourself with the public_content scope.

So, do this: https://gist.github.com/mojaray2k/b502d75dd7a9fa277876

But use the following for getting an access-token (Note the scope param):

https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=REDIRECT-URI&response_type=token&scope=public_content

Then you can search for the user id with:

https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/search?q=USER-NAME&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN

And get their feed with (or drop the user id and access token into instafeed):

https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/USER-ID/media/recent/?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN
<issue_comment>username_26: @username_67 this only returns results for the approved account, the search doesn't return the user ID it gives this:

`{
    ""meta"": {
    ""code"": 200
},
    ""data"": []
}`

and if you do provide a user ID other than your own you get:

`{
    ""meta"": {
        ""error_type"": ""OAuthAccessTokenException"",
        ""code"": 400,
        ""error_message"": ""The access_token provided is invalid.""
    }
}`
<issue_comment>username_68: Hi there,
I have my application approved on all the Permissions so far except the ""relationships"" is pending.

I am performing an api request on the user's behalf through out their tokens to retrieve the media feeds of a separate page on instagram using the below URL

https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/texasffa/media/recent/?access_token=3438260254.0a8fe73.381847b1f74f4e29b9d0aaec82934344

This page is redirecting me to an instagram ""page isn't available""

Is this API deprecated ? Is it the right way to read other page's feeds?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_68 Looks like you have used an account username `texasffa`, where you are suppose to use the user ID `21345123`.
<issue_comment>username_67: @username_26 interesting...  I have an app working in just the way I described above, but I'm definitely getting the same output as you if I try it with a different user...  it still works fine with the account I had originally set it up for....  I'm going to play with this some more and see if I can figure out what is happening.

I am definitely grabbing images from a clients account through my sandbox instagram app though, it is pulling into their website just fine.
<issue_comment>username_69: @username_26 @username_67 I ran into the same issue that username_26 described.  I can pull my own account fine, but even with the public_content tag, it won't let me pull from another users.  According to the instagram documents, I needed to add them as a sandbox user.  It wouldn't let me even authorize my app because it said authorization was unnecessary if I just wanted to grab one users feed...

So now i'm awkwardly waiting for my client to accept the sandbox invite... 👎
<issue_comment>username_67: @username_69 they could at least send an email with the invite, but no, you have to have your client go find the developer page and the invites tab.

Still not sure how a couple of mine are working right now without having the client accepting an invite, but it is...
<issue_comment>username_69: @username_67 thanks for the heads up! I have their login info so I went to the developer site for them and accepted it.  That is absurd though, I assumed it just sent an email.

cheers!
<issue_comment>username_70: hey ppl, try this one: 

`https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=YOUR-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=YOUR-REDIRECT-URI&response_type=code&scope=basic+comments+follower_list+likes+relationships+public_content`

after a few hours, finally worked for me =D
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_70 I **very strongly** recommend **against** doing that. You have requesting every single scope possible, which is potentially dangerous. You should only need `basic` and `public_content`.

If you generate a token with those scopes, the token will have the permission to follow/unfollow people (`relationships`), like/unlike on your behalf (`likes`), comment/uncomment on your behalf (`comments`), and see what followers you have (`follower_list`), and who you follow (`follower_list`).

You are basically giving that token full access to your account, and if your token is going on a _public_ html page, anyone who finds that token could potentially use it to act on your behalf.

#### Do not generate tokens with anything more than `public` and `basic_content`.
<issue_comment>username_70: @username_2 yeah... public_content is what the error points to... of course you must choose what you might need in your application! I forgot to mention that, but thank you a lot and sorry for that miss! =p
<issue_comment>username_26: Waiting 3 working days now for approval ~230 feeds down, and obviously do't want to have to chase that many clients up to authenticate our app if possible - our hotfix for the minute is to use the same access point Instagram uses to display their images http://www.instagram.com/username/media

<issue_comment>username_74: I barely started using instafeed last week and I got it to work! However i have some questions, Ive been looking all around the internet but couldnt find anything.

1.) is it dangerous/risky to have my access token open to the public, can they do any harm to my account?

2.)is there any way to hide my access token, I have my java script file out in the open so if anyone wants to see my access token they easily could is there a way I can keep that javascript file hiddent or something like that?

Any help would be appreciated, I am kind of new to coding so I might have noob questions but soon ill understand :p
<issue_comment>username_74: @username_17 so when getting my access token i just use scope=public_content and nothing else to make sure it can only access your public content/pictures? One more question, so is it possible to only allow the access token to work on my web app. Thanks a lot! I really appreciate the help :D.
<issue_comment>username_40: I have approved for public_content clientId. To get access token I send request to www.instagram.com: GET /oauth/authorize?client_id=MyClientId&redirect_uri=MyRedirectURL&response_type=code&scope=likes+comments+public_content HTTP/1.1

After authentication browser redirect me to MyRedirectURL and I can get code from URL.

With this code I send request to api.instagram.com: /oauth/access_token HTTP/1.1 client_id=MyClientId&client_secret=MyClientSecret&grant_type=authorization_code&redirect_uri=MyRedirectURL&code=CodeFromURL

But sometimes I get response HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request. This situation continues for a few hours and sometimes for a day. It is interesting that problem is very unstable, I may have two client apps that make identical requests. And one app will works fine, and another will fail at the same time. Looks like it is a problem somewhere in Instagram infrastructure.
<issue_comment>username_75: Try our free Instamax plugin that works with a Access Token and eliminates the Client ID problem -
http://www.username_75.com/p/username_75-free-plugins.html
<issue_comment>username_23: @username_2 you had said you were _""evaluating options for how to handle authentication going forward.""_  What is your current take on the situation and future of instafeed.js? What would you recommend someone do right now if they wanted to use your plugin to embed media beyond the scope of their own most recent 20?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_23 Thanks for asking!

My original goal was to build a helper page that would allow users to log in with their Instagram accounts, and it would generate the token for you, as well as give you some copy-paste snippets for getting started with Instafeed.js.

However, after [I made](https://github.com/username_2/instafeedjs-helper) the helper page, and submitted it to Instagram for approval, it was rejected. The library name ""Instafeed.js"" doesn't fit within their brand guidelines (""insta"" is not allowed).

I reached out to a member of the Instagram team, and they aren't making any exceptions to this rule. So without renaming the library, I don't think I'll be able to build any approved apps to help with this process.

I'm not opposed to renaming Instafeed.js (though it'd be a bummer), but even if I did, I don't think my helper app would be approved. My understanding is that Instagram wants everyone to submit their API access requests independently.

I realize this is disappointing for everyone (it is for me too, I don't even have an approved app for my own personal use). At this point, I don't have any ideas on what to do from here, so I'd love to hear from the community if anyone has recommendations.
<issue_comment>username_74: @username_75 is this 100% open source? can i use it in my personal website without giving credit?

<issue_comment>username_76: Hello! 
Anyone that have request public_content had success with Instagram approval??
Anyone received a different automatic response?
""This permission (public_content) is only granted to apps that enable brands, advertisers, broadcasters and publishers to discover public content. We do not grant access to apps that do not fall into these categories. Please review our documentation (https://www.instagram.com/developer/review) for more information""

Anyone know Instagram support contact for developer??
is the six time that I try this submission!!
Thanks
<issue_comment>username_77: @username_76 at the moment the simplest solution is to scrape it:

the question it is ethical and legal?:)
<issue_comment>username_54: It's against their API rules. Definately not ""legal"".

<issue_comment>username_79: @username_2 can you share the code you used to get the sandbox mode working? For my use case, and I suspect many others, I just need need the last 9 or so images
<issue_comment>username_80: I was approved for basic only and not for public_content... so I have app that wants to connect/share users instagram photos to their profile, just like how Tinder does.  So public_content has to be used for this, right? or can basic permission also accomplish instagram photos to your profile?
<issue_comment>username_81: Just curious, I am new to this... I registered my 'client' and have a clientId and used that api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize link to give my website public_content perms.
Are we still limited to only getting 20 pics still via any client-side js like Instafeed.js?

If I switched to a different server-side plugin, would that then be easier to get more than 20 pics?
Is there an easy way getting Instafeed.js to return >= 20 images? I guess I saw maybe people caching old images via more complicated solutions, but would rather not go a custom route on my Drupal server. Definitely liking the simplicity of setting up Instafeed.js and extra complexity it offers if I need it for templating.

Thanks,
Ari
<issue_comment>username_82: @username_5 Hi, I develop WordPress themes and use PixelUnion app to generate tokens for the Instagram feed section of my themes.

I have tried to get basic permission several times with no luck. I see that you got basic permission for your app successfully. It would be really helpful if you share from your experience like which use case you chose and how you described it.
<issue_comment>username_5: Hi @username_82 ,

I don't remmeber exactly but if I think I emphasize on the number 3 use case, saying that we're helping broadcasters and shop owner to share media using their own account.

We explained that this is used only to help shop owners to promote their own activity with their photos only.

Then we attached a short video showing how the integration work, from step 1 where they use our website to fetch the token, to the final result on a real-life store showing our Instagram integration.
<issue_comment>username_82: @username_5 Thank you so much for your reply. It helps me a lot.
<issue_comment>username_83: Hello,
   My basic permission not granted. can you help problem related to below
    In instagram login can i login without instagram login authorize page without ask permission like ""Access your basic information"".
<issue_comment>username_84: Hello,
the instafeed is working for me, but it's publishing every post twice.
Wich means if I do limit:""4"", I'll get 8 post, with every post in double (4 different images twice). 

Anyone knows why?
<issue_comment>username_85: Hi,

here is my script : 
`<script type=""text/javascript"">
    var feed = new Instafeed({
        clientId: 'myclientid',
        accessToken: 'myaccesstoken',
        template: '<a href=""{{link}}""><img src=""{{image}}"" /></a>',
        sortBy: 'most-recent',
        limit: '10',
        resolution: 'thumbnail'
    });
    feed.run();
</script>`

I just want to display the 10 last post from my instagram account on my website.
With this script, I have this error : error : invalid media id.

Of course my application is declared on instagram website and is in sandbox mode.

Thanks for your help.
<issue_comment>username_86: @username_26 To complete your answer in case anybody else struggles in making their app being approved by instagram, in this scenario instagram doesn't allow to make jsonp call on https://www.instagram.com/username/media/ so basically you have to put up a ws which il something like  echo file_get_contents(https://www.instagram.com/username/media/'') and then make a std ajax call on that.
<issue_comment>username_87: Hi Guys, I've been following this thread a lot before I got approved to find all the clues on how to get approved because it was really frustrating that Instagram kept on rejecting my app even if I followed all their instructions and terms.

So I just want to share to the community on what I did how I my Instagram app got approved. So just the usual disclaimer, this is not a guarantee that you'll get approved, but I hope some of the things below make sense.

## 1. Use all the combinations, polish, be patient, never give up

- This sounds like a cliche, but believe me, Instagram will really test your patience. I actually stopped for two weeks from submitting out of frustration, before I re-submitted my last 2 submissions and got approved the last time.

- The trick is constantly polishing the 3 combinations you're submitting:

i) Choosing the use case - ""Which use case best describes your Instagram integration?""

ii) Describing the use case - ""How does your app use this permission""

iii) Screencast - ""Video Screencast URL""

## 2. Choosing the use case issue

- So one of the most confusing part of the submission is the use case. And up to now I still do not fully understand those that are related to public_content permission. So basically I chose between two permissions to justify my need for public_content:

a) ""My product helps brands and advertisers understand, manage their audience and media rights.""

b) ""My product helps broadcasters and publishers discover content, get digital rights to media, and share media with proper attribution.""

And I kept choosing (b) when submitting my app but I only got ""basic"" permission approved using it. I submitted so many times using (b) and just kept changing my video screen cast, and API use case paragraphs.

It was when in my last two submissions and I chose (a) that I got approved.

## 3. Describing the use case

- Another confusing part is Instagram asks you to describe the API use case in section 3 then in section 4 when you choose additional permissions, it asks you to describe it again: ""How does your app use this permission"". Which to me, ""Why? I already described everything in detail in section 3!""

- I tried a lot of combinations here, I tried Use Case description and public_content description to be completely different, and describe each in detail, but to no avail. Always rejected. In my last two submissions, I actually got tired already of making long paragraphs, so I wrote a new one in full details how I'll use the permissions I needed. Including the technical details (like the logic in the program) and just copy-pasted it both in section 3 and 4. Since my basic permission was already approved at this point.

## 4. Video Screencast

- I did a lot of revisions in my youtube video and re-submitted several times. I tried a long introduction to say what I said in my use case, did not work. I tried incorporating live video of our events in different brands, did not work.

- What really worked, I think, was to be straightforward, focus on the use case, and include technical details as well. So what I did was made the introduction very concise, like only few seconds long, and went on with the flow, and as I was describing the flow (logging in to the website, etc), I was explaining as well the programming logic behind the decision related to the API use case of Instagram. Like when it's time to integrate with Instagram auth, I'll switch to Sublime Text and show them a piece of code where I'm actually using the IG auth. Same way with public_content permission.

You have to convince them that it's not a one off project, and your video really satisfies the use case you explained and selected. I also stayed away from discussing about web gallery integration, coz I have a feeling that they automatically reject this kind of app (not 100% sure).

Another good chance that you're in the right direction is when your rejection message changes. My second to the last submission, the message changed from permissions issue to issue about our brand might mislead people that we are partners with Instagram. So in the final submission, I just removed Instagram mentions from all of our brands (also had to re-do the screencast because of this).

I actually got teary eyed the morning I checked my Instagram client and got the coveted green button ""Approved"" for public_content instead of the denied button with a vague message why your app was rejected. Instagram doesn't even notify you if there are changes in your permission approval, so it's a daily anxiety of checking in the developer centre. 

If anyone wants to check out more about the use case of my app, you may do so, and yes this is a slightly shameless plug as well: it's ""Hashtag Circle"". I won't post the link as it's straightforward what's the website, and we're on social media as well.

Now, I don't know if all of the above changes really amounted to something or it was just like ""a guy from Instagram was having a good day"" so I got approved. Maybe luck, maybe not. Or maybe they're starting to loosen up, haha! But this was my experience, I hope it helps! And thank you as well as I learned a lot from this thread.
<issue_comment>username_82: Hi @username_87,

Thank you so much for sharing your experience. It is really really really helpful. I just have one quick question.

Do you think there is a chance of public_content approval for Instagram photo printing service if it doesn't print from hashtag? People really want to print their friends' photos, however, I have only basic permission. I just would like to know how you feel about this as a person who got public_content permission (YAY! Congrats on your approval!)
<issue_comment>username_87: @username_82 I believe so! There are other end points that use public_content without using hashtag, e.g. the media based on location or the user media end point.  However, reading your initial description I already feel that the case is very weak to get public_content approved. 

It's really important that you relay properly the details that build your case that this is not for one-off use, and you fall specifically on the use case you chose. It's rationalising to them that you're using the specific end point that needs public_content permission to achieve your use case.
<issue_comment>username_88: So to resume actually it's ""impossible"" to grab all public images by an # and display them on a website ? Thank you for the answer
<issue_comment>username_17: from what I followed the discussion for the past months, if you don't have a real plausible explanation (and a good amount of luck or a well known name behind your project), yes.
<issue_comment>username_88: @username_17 Okay it's pretty sad because I tried to implement a Twitter list based on # but you can't do a reactive one (You need to create a widget for each Hashtag) and I can't with Instagram too...
<issue_comment>username_17: if you read through the thread here, there is plenty of options to work around restrictions - which might be sufficient for personal projects..
<issue_comment>username_88: @username_17 I readed the discussion and yeah I didn't find a way to display a list of posts by a specific # (For the moment I display my 20 last pictures because that works )
<issue_comment>username_37: I gave up on the API. I created a PHP script that scrapes the actual page and extracts the JSON on my account page, which includes all the details necessary to copy the images to my local server, and create an includable file. I run it by cron every few minutes.

The full script I currently use is here, and I've extracted the more important code below:
https://github.com/username_37/wsdl-cascade/blob/master/scrapeInstagram.php

```
$curl = curl_init();
curl_setopt_array($curl, array(
	CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER => 1,
	CURLOPT_URL => ""https://www.instagram.com/"".$account.'/'
));
$curlresult = curl_exec($curl);
curl_close($curl);

$scrape = preg_match('/window\._sharedData = .*environment_switcher_visible_server_guess"": true}/', $curlresult, $matches);

$json = str_replace('window._sharedData = ','', $matches[0]);
$data = json_decode($json);
$media = $data->entry_data->ProfilePage[0]->user->media->nodes;
foreach ($media as $key => $value) {
	copy($value->thumbnail_src, ""./instagram/"".$account.'-'.$value->code.'.jpg' )
	// Also add code for this image to a variable, e.g. $HTMLoutput .= ""<img src='"". $value->code .""'.jpg''/>"";
}
// Write the $HTMLoutput to a file.
```

Hope it's helpful.
<issue_comment>username_88: @username_37 I've seen earlier this script but how should I use it ? I need to run it on my computer ? Include it in my project ? (Sorry for spamming)
<issue_comment>username_37: Yes, you would need to create a PHP file on your server that you run on the command line via a cron task. If you don't have that kind of access to your server, this solution probably won't work for you.
<issue_comment>username_61: For the ones who are still having this discussions, you should check out [PHP-Instagram-Grabber](https://github.com/Bolandish/PHP-Instagram-Grabber) or for [Image hashtag feed](https://github.com/digitoimistodude/image-hashtag-feed) for WordPress.
<issue_comment>username_89: just insert tags you want to get feed and get feed url
http://mydreams.lt/instagram-scraper/
<issue_comment>username_90: It's baaaaack!
<issue_comment>username_91: Error is back for me too username_90. Anyone have a fix? Thanks, Ben
<issue_comment>username_92: same issue here...
<issue_comment>username_93: Same, none of the above comments worked for me, tried to submit for review but:

`You do not need to submit for review for this use case. Some widgets may ask you to register a new client ID, but you should not submit it for review for the widget to work. Your client can remain in sandbox mode and the widget will have access to your last 20 media. If you are having issues with the widget, please contact the owner of the widget directly.`
<issue_comment>username_94: Hi guys, I just got an issue that I think it is probably related to this thread.
My client just reported that our instafeed is not working lately. It's just showing 1-2 images.
I've been trying to run instafeed in plain js, and yes it just returns 1 image right now.
Here is the url of api request:
https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/1834716219/media/recent?access_token=1834716219.78c795b.144cef2e29a4459eb86f2304548c7a51&callback=instafeedCache53f6eb524171d00a.parse
I have tried to create new app with the same IG account.
Weirdly, if I try with another app from another IG account it works to return 20 images.
url request: https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/222640218/media/recent?access_token=222640218.2900948.99c831db9eb044f3b99889507c33f8e6&callback=instafeedCachec08b7d4b445153dd.parse

NB: both apps are in sandbox mode

Does anybody know what happening here?
<issue_comment>username_95: @username_94 - those two example requests are using two different User ID's `1834716219` and `222640218`. Is that a typo? That would explain the differing results, right?
<issue_comment>username_94: It is not typo. Indeed they are different. I just want to show why it works on an app but doe not work on another app. Both apps are sandbox mode.
<issue_comment>username_95: The ""non-working"" profile here: https://www.instagram.com/lovebonitoid/ has zero posts as of now (in fact, when I first checked, I got 1 media item, now I get zero. Is that an account you control?
<issue_comment>username_94: OMG, that's becoming weirder. No, it should have a lot of posts. I accessed that page via desktop browser around 7 hours ago, the posts were still there. Now they are gone. But if you check via mobile app right now, the posts actually exists.
<issue_comment>username_54: Looks like that account is ""broken"" or somewhow blocking all external accounts (it's the same message when you get blocked by an account). you can see there are over 2000 posts and it's even verified. Would suggest to contact IG about this issue.
<issue_comment>username_94: hi @username_54 thank you for your response. 
yeah, I think I need to contact IG about this.
<issue_comment>username_80: Just received another Instagram API email update that accelerated most of the api use disabled, effective immediately. Then these will be disabled:

Public Content - all remaining capabilities to read public media on a user's behalf on December 11, 2018
Basic - to read a user’s own profile info and media in early 2020
————

My question is when Basic is removed will anyone be able to still login with Instagram username to an app? Like the typical web view within app and logging into Instagram to Auth?  Like tinder you can login in once to connect your Instagram so users can view your profile.
<issue_comment>username_95: @username_80 's update is in the changelog here, I think: https://www.instagram.com/developer/changelog#april-4-2018

```
The following endpoints are deprecated immediately:

Follows and Relationships

GET /users/self/follows
GET /users/self/followed-by
GET /users/self/requested-by
GET /users/{user-id}/relationship
POST /users/{user-id}/relationship

Commenting on Public Content

GET /media/{media-id}/comments (Deprecation not relevant when fetching comments for self media)
POST /media/{media-id}/comments
DEL /media/{media-id}/comments/comment-id

Likes

GET /media/{media-id}/likes
POST /media/{media-id}/likes
DEL /media/{media-id}/likes

User Search

GET /users/{user-id}
GET /users/{user-id}/media/recent
GET /users/self/media/liked
GET /users/search

Subscriptions - to receive notifications when media is posted
Some information on Public Content returned through hashtag and location search will be removed - Name, Bio, Comments, Commenters, Follower Count, Following Count, Post Count, and Profile Picture
```

To me, these ""effective immediately"" deprecations smell like security patches (or security theatre) as a damage control response to the Facebook data leakage media storm that's going on at the moment. The deprecated endpoints focus on the social graph: what people like, where they comment, who they follow, etc. That 'spiderable graph' is exactly what Facebook is in trouble over at the moment.
<issue_comment>username_95: **UPDATE (@username_2):** This thread has turned into a conversation about how Instafeed.js is going to work with Instagram's [new API restrictions](http://developers.instagram.com/post/133424514006/instagram-platform-update).

Currently, new Instagram API clients are not able to fetch much of the data that Instafeed.js relied on to work, and we are evaluating options for how to handle authentication going forward. Credentials created before the API restrictions went live are not affected for now.

**Original Post**:
I'm working on a client project (built on Shopify platform) and am looking to pull in their Instagram posts by user. I have it all setup - but it will not pull in my client's account. When I plug in my personal Instagram account userId & clientId, everything works perfect so I know it's not an issue with how I have it set up. Are there any known security settings that will prevent instafeed from working on a specific account? To note, the account I'm looking to pull in has a very large following.. not sure if that has anything to do with it?

Here's the set-up I have for reference (includes liquid language as used on Shopify, so just ignore that): 

<!-- Instafeed -->

```
{% assign instafeed_img = '{{image}}' %}
{% assign instafeed_link = '{{link}}' %}
{% assign instafeed_likes = '{{likes}}' %}
{{ 'instafeed.min.js' | asset_url | script_tag }}
<script type=""text/javascript"">

var userFeed = new Instafeed({
    target: 'instafeed',
    get: 'user',
    userId: '260149935',
    clientId: 'xxx',
    limit: '10',
    sortBy: 'most-recent',
    resolution: 'standard_resolution',
  template: '<div class=""grid__item large--one-fifth""><a href=""{{ instafeed_link }}"" target=""_blank""><img src=""{{ instafeed_img }}""><span class=""likes""><span class=""icon icon-heart"" aria-hidden=""true""></span>{{ instafeed_likes }}</span></a></div>'
});
userFeed.run();
</script>
```
<issue_comment>username_96: So just confirming, as of 2020, we're out of luck for any means to pull pictures from a site hey?

I looked into scraping and Facebook has kindly decided to use random hash generated class names and ID's so that scraping is off the table :/
<issue_comment>username_95: That's correct: ""[Complete deprecation in early 2020](https://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/2018/01/30/instagram-graph-api-updates/)"".

Regarding scraping, the reason you're seeing those classes in the DOM is because instagram.com is a React app and the DOM is all built with javascript. Scraping it would still be technically possible, but a) complex, because you need an agent which can execute javascript, and b) against IG's terms of service, and so likely to be thwarted and/or get IPs blocked, the target account in trouble, etc.

It's a shame that IG's as a platform for embeddable content is going away, but (IMO) better to accept it than spend forever trying to swim against the current.
<issue_comment>username_96: Yea it is. It's a great way to show social proof that there is something more behind the website by showing their social presence. 

Scraping as a Node app would be possible with a reverse proxy and done via Pupeteer or something, but I don't know if/how it would be possible to do it in-browser. Shame really.
<issue_comment>username_97: @username_96 React does not create those ugly classes. You can use React with normal css classes. It's just that with React ecosystem, most people use a ""css-in-js"" solution that often generate classes name to avoid collision so you don't have to think about those. Twitter is using the same technique this days. Like all ""big corp"" apps. Easier maintenance.

To go back to the main problem here, I think we could go and use graphql api as soon as it's available for normal users...
<issue_comment>username_95: Ah, it's the CSS-in-JS stuff, that makes sense, thanks.

Thanks for the heads-up too, @username_97 - I'd missed the announcement that the Graph API would be opened to individual users. Last I saw, it was only announced for businesses. Have to do some more reading - cheers.
<issue_comment>username_98: Any news on this topic?
<issue_comment>username_99: Wouldn't we be able to pull media objects for Business Profiles through the Graph API?
<issue_comment>username_100: Oh, I just read that now, too bad! Yesterday I was happy to finally get my Instagram feed on my site with instafeed.js, and now I'm reading that it won't work any more soon... I hope that there will be something similar then...?
<issue_comment>username_101: I think they've added basic permissioning for non-business profiles now to the new graph api: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/media
<issue_comment>username_2: I haven't heard of the Instagram Creator Account feature before, but [Instagram's Help Article](https://help.instagram.com/2358103564437429) makes it seem like its an additional product you have to request on your account.
<issue_comment>username_101: Hi @username_2 

Yeah I saw on the [IG User page](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/user) after I posted that you need have (or change to) a business or creator account. I think you then have to link your account to a facebook page before you can use the facebook api. I gave up at that point as I didn't have the facebook log in for the client I was trying to set it up for, but I think it should be doable now with either a creator or business account, so long as you have a facebook page. Hopefully they remove that limitation in the future.
<issue_comment>username_102: **How i can get on my website (only code html, css, js):  ""Getting images from your user account"" ?
should be in:** 

  `   <script  type = ""text/javascript""  src = ""js/instafeed.min.js""> </script>`
next: 
```
<!--INSTAFEED.JS-->
<div class=""container"" id=""insta"">
<div id=""instafeed""></div>
</div>
<script type=""text/javascript"">
    var userFeed = new Instafeed({
  get: '****',
  userId: ****,
  accessToken: '****'
});
userFeed.run();
</script>
```

Pls help me. 
and one more question. When i put on them, in 2020 it isnt work?
my IG accound is add to FB page.
<issue_comment>username_103: I'm a little confused with the above posts as I've set up a page and 5/7 hashtags are working. 
Does anyone have any advice? 

https://featherstonehomes.co.uk/sites.php
<issue_comment>username_95: Hi @username_103 - what you're seeing is using the remaining ""get my own posts"" behaviour, with the  filter by tag done as a second step. You can't fetch directly by tag anymore ""show me all public posts tagged with `x`"".

The reason you won't see all of the tags work - or at least, how well they work, if at all - is because the API will only give you your (IIRC) 20 most recent posts. If none of those posts have the tag you're filtering by, you'll end up with no posts in your filtered set.
<issue_comment>username_104: take a look at https://github.com/jsanahuja/jquery.instagramFeed its working without API
<issue_comment>username_95: @username_104 - That's ... surprising! It's basically a web-scraper in Javascript, and works because IG's web endpoints are setting a [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header on the response which matches any `Origin` header you send. A couple of thoughts on that:

- That's an interesting/odd policy for something like IG. Ordinarily, a request like this would be blocked - javascript on a website can only request from it's own domain (the same-origin policy), or a host which sets that `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to allow the domain. The fact that IG appears to be allowing any origin suggests they're deliberately allowing this behaviour. I tested with an origin of ""Blah Blah"" and it worked - it doesn't need to even be a domain. Is this intentional? Accidental? Who knows - it's definitely not common though. To compare, facebook.com doesn't have this policy.

- The fact that this is undocumented (AFAICT) gives it unknown reliability. If IG's CORS policy ever changes, everything relying on this will stop working without warning.

- The fact that it's scraping the returned HTML makes it much less reliable. A scraper must make assumptions about the contents of the page it's scraping (for instance, this script relies on the string `window._sharedData = ` appearing in the page exactly. If IG ever change this (even adding or removing a space), this will stop working without warning.

Personally, I wouldn't rely on this for anything critical in production. At least with the API changeover, there's a published plan to refer to. That said, it is a neat solution to the problem, and the library itself looks well written and high quality at first glance.
<issue_comment>username_105: Hi guys - Was hoping to get some help on the new API settings for instafeed - I have went through the steps of setting up a facebook developer account ect - 

I am on step 4 of the tutorial: 

https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-basic-display-api/getting-started

And this is where I am lost? 
Am i supposed to change the instafeed.js script with: 

```
https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize
  ?app_id={app-id}
  &redirect_uri={redirect-uri}
  &scope=user_profile,user_media
  &response_type=code
```

My apologies if this is a slightly noobish question, any help would be warmly appreciated.

username_0: ## Proposal

One of the things I like about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is its [plugin](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins) system, which allows you to weave arbitrary Ruby logic into various points in the build pipeline. I think that the benefits of this for Hugo are pretty clear, and I've seen plugin proposals floated in past issues (#321) and community discussions.

It recently came to my attention in the [Tools/libraries that can drive new Hugo features](https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/tools-libraries-that-can-drive-new-hugo-features/7891) discussion that there's a [Lua interpreter written in Go](https://github.com/Azure/golua)---actually [more than one](https://github.com/Shopify/go-lua)---that could, with some massaging, be used to enable Hugo users to run Lua scripts as part of the Hugo build pipeline.

## Basic feature outline

This is obviously majorly up for discussion, but I envision something like this:

* Initially plugins would be disabled by default; you'd need to set an `--enablePlugins` flag to use it
* You could can a `plugins` directory to your Hugo project; at run time, Hugo would scan that directory for Lua files
* For an initial implementation, you would name files based on where in the build pipeline you'd want the logic to run. A file called `prebuild.lua` would run before Hugo does anything, `prepage.lua` would manipulate each page before Hugo does, `postbuild.lua` would run after Hugo is done with everything, and so on.
* Eventually, you could use these scripts to add new templating functions, create project-specific Markdown extensions, etc. Anything you see [here](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-plugins) would conceivably be within reach.

## Basic example

I'll provide a super simplistic example because I'm not yet super familiar with Lua. Imagine a `postpage.lua` script that runs after Hugo has processed a page. Imagine if for some reason you wanted to make the title of each page in the `blog` section lowercase:

```lua
# plugins/postpage.lua
for i, page in ipairs(pages) do
  if page.section == 'blog' then
    page.title = string.lower(page.title)
  end
end
```

## Feedback

Is this something that would be beneficial for Hugo? Does this seem like a vaguely reasonable approach? Worth the effort? Not the right direction for the project? Too much flexibility? Too much power?
<issue_comment>username_1: I think it would helps to tell us a little about the use cases. What common situations today cannot easily be done in Hugo? I' don't think the Jekyll are very relevant.

I think this discussion wires nicely into a couple of other issues (that I have quietly been building up to with some of the technical upgrades I've been doing (also the current task)):

* Adding page metadata from outside of the pages
* Adding pages from data sources

It would obviously be golden if I could both the above in a flexible plugin way that maintains the ... snappines of Hugo.

<issue_comment>username_2: Just my issue, so I will leave my two cents :)

First a little story for my motivation:
I am currently migrating my WordPress blog. I hate Gutenberg and his bugs and I want to be in control of the output, not having 10 different rendings of the same block, because over 2 years there were 10 different buggy implementions.

First I started implementing my own blog software with Kotlin, Spring and used markdown files and a separate YAML files for meta data, such as date, title, categories and tags.

Then I found out about static site generators and researched. I found Hugo and Jekyll as the top runners to have a deeper look into. In the end I chose Hugo, because I am no Ruby guy.

I am now busy for a few weeks, nearly finished having the site looking the same as in WordPress. However I must forfeit WordPress's archives (`/yyyy` and `/yyyy/mm` arranged lists by year and month). I searched the web and found these
- https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/monthly-archive-pages-for-blog/122/7
- https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/pagination-and-group-by-date/1441
- https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-to-generate-chronological-blog-archives-in-hugo/13491

They are just the same ""solutions"" I could imagine: Misusing Hugo's taxonomies to archive the archives.
Now plugins come to play.

I do not want to repeat data, i.e. 
- setting *each month* a fresh taxonomy in the config and
- appending year and month in **each post**'s meta data

when the data is already there!

`publishDate: 2017-04-22 23:56:00` makes it clear, I want to have this post in the archives sites `/archives/2017.html` and `/archives/2017/04.html`. I only need to tell Hugo about that :wink: 

---

For this use-case I would Hugo need to supply me with a means of telling it what URLs to generate.
For example
```kt
addListener('allUrls') { hugo ->
  // Hugo gives me a list of all URLs it currently would generate
  // I can add/remove to my liking.
  val allMonths = hugo.allUrls
    .map { it.data[""publishDate""].toYearMonth() }
    .distinct()

  allMonth.forEach { hugo.allUrls += ""/archive/${it.year}/${it.month}"" }
  allMonth.map { it.year }.distinct().forEach { hugo.allUrls += ""/archive/$it"" }
}
```
(My Lua is a bit rusty, so Kotlin pseudo code)

Maybe I would need to pass Hugo a hint, which template, or this can be done with sections. I am not that deep into Hugo.

---

Thinking larger you can imagine a lot of different hooks where you can allow the plugin developer to 
- alter the input (manipulate data, create dynamic data, ...) before Hugo generates
- alter the output
- even manipulate a HTML tag, before Hugo writes it (use-case for me would be to add `href=""_blank""` to certain outgoing links; my workaround was to switch the markup engine to `blackfriday`, because the default engine does not has `hrefTargetBlank`!)
- alter the configuration (dynamicly change the config based on environment, thinking maybe of CI/CD)
- implement shortcodes as code

Hope that gives you a few ideas to continue here, really would like to see a start :)
Don't want to threaten, but I already had the idea to switch to Jekyll after I have the site ready, because of this lack of extensibility...
<issue_comment>username_2: Just checked my TODO list.

More ideas a plugin can achieve:
- Link checker: When generating a link, we can check whether the page exists and print a warning or abort the generation
- Ensure code style: A plugin could check, for example whether all `div` tags with a `cell` class either have a `even` or an `odd` class).
- I can write a dynamic generation for `title` and `url`. Right now, if I have a specify schema (not just replace space with hyphen), I have to specify the URL in each post (see https://gohugo.io/content-management/urls/#set-url-in-front-matter)
- have more control over [image processing](https://gohugo.io/content-management/image-processing/) - right now Hugo generates really ugly URLs :(
  - see https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/change-file-name-for-resized-image-resources/14219"

# Description
Tags are a powerful way to segment users and allow users to specify what type of content they want to receive notifications about.

Right now, adding tags to a user requires writing code, but we’d like to extend the webSDK permission prompt to let users specify what they want to receive notifications about.

It is great to list each significant change here - this makes it easier for reviewers to confirm everything you intended to do is actually there AND nothing extra is accidentally in there.

username_0: cc @username_2 due to [his related comment on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/b6pygw/little_typo_on_introducing_c/ejod2l7/)

In order to make it easier for the community to directly contribute to Godot's website as needed, rather than access being limited to those with website credentials for October, perhaps we could migrate the website to a static site generator?
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 It does seem like a more sustainable approach.

I think migrating templates would be easy enough, it's the content that could be bothersome, as static site generators tend to rely heavily on every page more or less just being a text document, so the structure might need some manual labour to correct.

I'm currently looking into upgrading the site to PHP7, after which I'll be a lot more knowledgeable about the challenges. If I end up with the impression that it would be feasible to do, I'll be glad to take on the project. 

Does @username_2, @reduz  and @akien-mga have opinions on this?
<issue_comment>username_0: I have not brought the idea up with anyone specifically. And I'm not entirely sure what scale of work would be involved in-depth.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 If you're interested in doing the groundwork, you could ask for a database dump on IRC to get the news posts with their formatting (`#godotengine-atelier` @ `irc.freenode.net`).
<issue_comment>username_1: @akien-mga @username_2 After rummaging through the code and content, I am quite confident that it could be a static site, GitHub Pages with default Jekyll would even suffice.

The asset library might even be eligible too.
<issue_comment>username_2: I don't think we plan on using GitHub Pages for hosting, so we could go for Hugo and deploy the HTML ourselves on TuxFamily. I'd favor Hugo over Jekyll for two reasons:

- It's much faster. This matters as the number on articles on the website will only grow as time goes on.
- Its community seems to be more active than Jekyll's nowadays, so it's easier to find up-to-date solutions to problems.

Regarding the asset library, I started an [Hugo-powered prototype](https://github.com/username_2/godot-asset-library-hugo) but after discussing with @username_3, we were starting to notice limitations that can't be overcome well with a static site generator (like tracking download counts or reviews, if planned). This is why I started [another prototype using Laravel](https://github.com/username_2/godot-asset-library-laravel), which is a much more complex task but it'd prevent us from running into limitations later on. I might be able to dedicate a significant amount of time to this task if my university agrees on it :slightly_smiling_face:
<issue_comment>username_0: Rather than Laravel, I would recommend Slim as it is just a lot simpler to work with. Would make it easier for people to get involved and, for a smaller application like this, will be easier to maintain overall imo. Thoughts?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 The current asset library backend uses Slim, and I think it's a bad idea for any sizeable application:

- Slim isn't as well-maintained as other popular PHP frameworks. Its community is quite small, so it's difficult to find solutions to problems.
- The performance overhead incurred by the use of a framework isn't an issue in our case, due to the relatively low amount of traffic. (Still, frameworks make it easy to apply optilizations such as caching.)
- Most professional developers use a full-ledged framework nowadays, and using one of these frameworks makes it easier to turn them into contributors.
- Your code will look different from most other backends out there, which means contributors will have to adapt to your style and paradigms.
  - This becomes even more true as you need to scale up the application, as there's no ""standard"" way to do so.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 good points all around. Sounds good then.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 @username_2 alright guys, I have another idea that lets us have both. I suggest, given the need for future expansion, that we split this task into a public API service and a separate static site.

This approach has 2 major a advantages:
1. A solid REST API would allow for tighter future integration with the Godot engine itself, as the client UI could be created with Godot widgets
2. We get to divide the work between server and client, making the process a lot leaner

If we create a specification of needed API endpoints first, then the frontend can even be developed against a dummy API, so one team doesn't have to wait for the other during development.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 This sounds like a really good approach. I likewise make a living with webdev, though I'm not quite as experienced as others here may be (only been in the professional world for about 3 years).
<issue_comment>username_2: Don't we already have this? https://github.com/godotengine/godot-asset-library/blob/master/API.md
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_2 it seems we do. Then don't we just need to expand this API to support the download count, reviews and other needed features and write a decoupled static frontend to present its content?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_1 By ""static frontend"", do you mean setting up a single-page application using a static site generator? That can be done, but if we're going to rewrite the backend, we can do that directly in the backend's codebase (Laravel plays well with Vue.js).

<issue_comment>username_3: Just to chime in:
I think most of the asset library might be moved to a static website. The only things that need to be dynamic might be done using JavaScript (for comments and reviews) or simple PHP scripts (for downloads -- the download link would just lead to our script, which then redirects or streams the response).
Things such as assets can be kept as static JSON files (already tested by @username_2, AFAIR), and maybe mirrored in a database for searches. Again, the script which does the search could be quite simple.
Finally, there would have to be a compatibility layer, which would be a set of scripts which the old versions of the engine can still use.
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_0 @username_1 @username_2 Bumping this as I just ran into a problem with trying to run the OctoberCMS site on Windows. Looks like the workflow for working on the site in a local dev environment favors a UNIX environment (.sh scripts and whatnot). While I could (and probably will) work out the issue, I would prefer separating the _website_ from the _content_. Static sites make this very easy. 

I recently converted my personal site from WordPress to [Jigsaw](https://jigsaw.tighten.co/) and found it _much_ easier to make updates because I didn't have to create an entire environment for running PHP, a database, etc. Just the static site generator.

I agree that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is probably the best option if we go this route. It is very popular and easy to get going.

In fact, we might not even have to ditch OctoberCMS for managing content. Just browsing it looks like there is [REST API plugin](https://octobercms.com/plugin/mohsin-rest) that [Hugo could consume](https://gohugo.io/templates/data-templates/#data-driven-content) to keep the workflow the same for content editors. When someone develops locally, when they build, it would just pull from the REST API in production so they would get the latest content without having to set up PHP/MariaDB environment on their machine.
<issue_comment>username_0: Not sure if this is at all relevant to this project, but it seems that [Windows will stop supporting future versions of PHP, starting with 8.0](https://www-theregister-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/www.theregister.com/AMP/2020/07/10/microsoft_php/?amp_js_v=a3&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQIKAGwASDYAQE%3D#aoh=15955664346389&csi=1&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theregister.com%2F2020%2F07%2F10%2Fmicrosoft_php%2F). I'm guessing Godot's stuff runs on Linux, but it does make contributing harder for folks on Windows machines if they literally can't run PHP to develop the site in tandem with everyone else in the community.
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_0 I don't think that will affect things practically too much. PHP runs 80% of the web so someone will carry on compiling for Windows, or use WSL. It would especially affect me because I'm a Laravel dev professionally but also like to game and make music, so Windows it is for now.

Anyway, I think we should work to make it as easy to contribute to the website as it is to contribute to the game engine itself.
<issue_comment>username_2: I'm in favor of migrating to Hugo, but this is a large task that needs to be approved by @akien-mga first. Last time I heard, he would rather have me focus on higher priority tasks :slightly_smiling_face:
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_4 you might want to look into running your webdev stuff in WSL, Docker or a virtual machine, if you're stuck with Windows. The web runs Linux, so there is little incentive to make web apps Windows compatible.

Either that, or start making music and gaming in Linux, which is what I'd always recommend ;)
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_2 sounds good, I understand. I would be willing to take a crack at this if there is consensus that it is a direction we want to move towards. Or maybe I'll just do a proof-of-concept anyway 🙂 

@username_1 WSL would probably be the way to go, it just hasn't worked well for me in the past. Guess I can try it again. Easier said than done moving to Linux. Games are getting pretty easy to run on Linux, but support for audio drivers is abysmal, especially for newer laptops.

My only objective here is to remove friction. I'll try to make the current system work with Windows and make a PR to the docs if I can get it going.
<issue_comment>username_5: Hello 👋  

Is the hugo port of the website on pause? I was looking through some of the website issues and this one seems right up my alley due to working on a static site workflow at my day job for a few years. I'd love to contribute to moving the website over to hugo if other are working on higher priority tasks.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_5 We haven't started doing any porting work to date.
<issue_comment>username_5: @username_2 yeah that makes sense! I'll make keep an eye out to see where this lands 🙂 

Are other issues up for grabs or do most of them require an approval? (first time contributor and want to make sure I'm not stepping on anyone's toes)
<issue_comment>username_2: There's not a whole lot of work to do on the website these days. That said, contributing to the documentation is always welcome: for the [main documentation](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs) and [class reference](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/community/contributing/updating_the_class_reference.html) respectively.
<issue_comment>username_2: Closing, as we discussed this with reduz and others and this won't be done to ensure the website remains easy to add blog posts to. Having a CMS also makes it easier to keep certain blog posts private until they are published (which may be required for grant announcements and the like).<issue_closed>"

### Describe the problem

I have had a API23 device(`huawei gra ul00`) and the battery level code would return `0`. 

### The one that worked for me is the following
```kotlin
val batteryStatus: Intent? = IntentFilter(Intent.ACTION_BATTERY_CHANGED).let { ifilter ->
                context.registerReceiver(null, ifilter)
            }

            val batteryPct: Float? = batteryStatus?.let { intent ->
                val level: Int = intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_LEVEL, -1)
                val scale: Int = intent.getIntExtra(BatteryManager.EXTRA_SCALE, -1)
                level * 100 / scale.toFloat()
            }

            if(batteryPct==null)
                return -2
            return  batteryPct.toInt()
```

Instead of

```kotlin
val batteryManager = getSystemService(Context.BATTERY_SERVICE) as BatteryManager
batteryLevel = batteryManager.getIntProperty(BatteryManager.BATTERY_PROPERTY_CAPACITY)
```

Imagined it might help others or give you leads to fix it so others don't have the same problem as I did.

Curious @username_2 to know why does removing gitpod “...warrant a discussion” to you?\r\n\r\nThe fact is that all of these tools are collecting user data and on a grand scale.  Further due to their enormous reach into ecosystems outside of Node, the risk to user privacy is orders of magnitude greater.  Unlike smaller tooling vendors where analytics/data collection stops when interacting with the specific tool stops, Google and Microsoft are able to continue probing the end user (developers) across products and outside of the scope of Node debugging.  Key data points gained from their tooling sources (like DevTools and VSCode) while a developer writes code can easily be linked to other data points from the same developer long after works is done for the day and the debugger been ended.

If one of these had sent email addresses back to their servers without mentioning that to the user, they couldn\'t simply pretend nothing had happened and they couldn\'t just change the description. Privacy violations by corporations usually result in lawsuits and financial losses, and that\'s why we tend to assume that safeguards are in place to prevent that from happening. The fact that you ""fixed"" the potential privacy issue only after we had to step in indicates that such safeguards do not exist in a sufficient manner for your tool.

# 4. Gitpod
Whilst just now trying to use Gitpod, I'm faced with another notice, requiring none other than my ""email address"".

Outside of node-inspect which is part of the Node project, [chrome-remote-interface](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface) remains because no obvious privacy concerns were visible to me.  However I [will bring attention to this issue](https://github.com/cyrus-and/chrome-remote-interface/issues/391) which I found rather timely/untimely, and I would caution the author of going down the extension route as it relates to the Node ecosystem.

The overarching theme here is that privacy issues remain with these other links, and as such they aught to be removed immediately and without delay.
<issue_comment>username_1: @benjamingr The page does not explicitely _recommend_ these third-party tools. It is a guide and as such provides basic information about the most popular debugging tools (which some would consider ""industry standard""). I think our users / readers would benefit more from a disclaimer on said page than from us removing all of these resources and references.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 I believe that the decision in the last PR was specifically about removing all 3rd chrome extensions... for me the decision was not primarily about privacy but about the risks of installing chrome extensions themselves.

As such I think that perhaps removing gitpod, a third party extension to github, might warrant a discussion... but removing chrome devtools, visual studio, and jetbrains seems out of scope of the initial decision. (I recognize that I have a conflict of interest regarding google products).

Would it maybe make sense to split these up in to 2 different PRs so we can discuss the merits of the two types of cases separately?
<issue_comment>username_0: Splitting the PR would be to imply that the issue at hand is different for these other tools, which it is not.  Regardless of the size/power of organizations behind said tools, the same Privacy concerns as raised only days ago should apply.  And in fact should be **more** paramount now and here.  Curious @username_2 to know why does removing gitpod “...warrant a discussion” to you?

The fact is that all of these tools are collecting user data and on a grand scale.  Further due to their enormous reach into ecosystems outside of Node, the risk to user privacy is orders of magnitude greater.  Unlike smaller tooling vendors where analytics/data collection stops when interacting with the specific tool stops, Google and Microsoft are able to continue probing the end user (developers) across products and outside of the scope of Node debugging.  Key data points gained from their tooling sources (like DevTools and VSCode) while a developer writes code can easily be linked to other data points from the same developer long after works is done for the day and the debugger been ended.  I could go on and on explaining this but we all know it.

The question is are we going to stick to these same principles now by merging this PR?  The evidence is strait-forward, the PR has been generated, I don't understand why approvals are absent.  Or does somehow different rules apply to you if your name is of a certain origin, or your wallet is bigger, or you're just more powerful...

I don’t see a benefit in splitting this PR and instead only see that doing so will serve to dilute the problem.
<issue_comment>username_2: I don't believe that making claims like this are operating in good faith and TBH makes me take pause at continuing to engage in this issue at all. I've done my best to outline the decision making model and suggested splitting up the PR so that we could discuss removing things on two separate merits. 1) removing extensions which could have elevated permissions and 2) removing tools that collect personal data.
<issue_comment>username_3: I'm in favor of any of the following:

* Removing all recommendations just because we shouldn't be in the business of picking winners among competing projects.
* Replacing the recommendations with one or more links to external guides to these things.
* Adding a disclaimer about how listing something in this guide does not constitute endorsement.

I am **opposed** to doing **anything** to this list on the supposed grounds of privacy. As has b een explained multiple times, it's not why NiM was removed.

So, as such, I'd be in favor of removing some or all of the things removed in this PR, but I'm opposed to this PR because I do not want to give any air to the idea that NiM was removed over privacy concerns, even if it was privacy concerns that initiated the conversation that eventually resulted in its removal.
<issue_comment>username_0: The PR doesn't need splitting because the issue is a singular one at this point.  That of Privacy.  That's been on the forefront of the discussions, let's keep it there, and focus on how the same concerns previously raised are entirely relevant to the tools at hand.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 to be very clear, I am not acting in this thread as ""an agent of google"". I am acting as a maintainer of the nodejs.org project, who is the group that makes decisions within this repo. My opinions regarding plugins do not reflect those of Google's and tbh you bringing that up as a discussion point makes me slightly uncomfortable engaging in this dialogue.

I'm going to choose to not participate in this thread because I don't believe that I can do so in an unbiased fashion and that I'm likely to quickly get defensive.
<issue_comment>username_4: Hello, there! Member of @nodejs/moderation here!

I appreciate that there are some legitimate grounds for dissatisfaction here, and that there may be some distrust and raw feelings at play. That said, the language is starting to feel pretty charged and it seems to me that there’s a certain amount of doubling down on tightly held positions that is veering into a counterproductive kind of engagement. Can everyone take a step back and breathe a little? I think it’s worth discussing @richtrott’s three bullet points further.

(I take no position on the merits of this PR; I’m only interested in helping to keep the conversation moving and constructive.)
<issue_comment>username_1: This still seems like the most reasonable choice to me.

@username_0

I understand that you might think it is unfair that these projects are treated differently than your own project. As long as we don't have a fixed set of rules to go by, the only option appears to be to base our decisions on a certain amount of trust towards the tools. This is subjective of course, and based on previous comments I understand that someone might prefer not to be part of the discussion. We are not trying to argue against you, we are trying to achieve what we consider to be best for everyone. Anyway, here is my analysis of the problem (but IANAL):

I disagree that collecting personal data is a privacy issue by itself. Not properly informing users about it, *that* is a privacy issue. So assuming what your project did was actually a GDPR violation, then it was a privacy issue. Under the same assumption, it might even have been unlawful and a criminal offense in some countries.

We tend to trust corporations with personal data since we believe they are bound by laws and regulations, and that any small mistake would have vast consequences. If one of these had sent email addresses back to their servers without mentioning that to the user, they couldn't simply pretend nothing had happened and they couldn't just change the description. Privacy violations by corporations usually result in lawsuits and financial losses, and that's why we tend to assume that safeguards are in place to prevent that from happening. The fact that you ""fixed"" the potential privacy issue only after we had to step in indicates that such safeguards do not exist in a sufficient manner for your tool. And sure, you can still be sued for violating people's privacy, but that's not our goal, we are not looking for legal disputes.
<issue_comment>username_0: And my disappointment continues to grow.  But I'm still taking a breather at @username_4 suggestion.  Everyone have a great weekend.

These ""corporations"" that ""we tend to trust"" do it all the time, period.  To suggest otherwise is misguided to say the least.

Finally, I hate that it seems like I'm picking on Google and Microsoft because I've always been of the opinion that if you don't like something, don't use it.  I choose both to use and to not use products from each of these companies.

The primary reason I'm pushing this PR is because I also believe in acting in a fair manner and on a level playing field, specifically as we're speaking about the tooling of Node, and of course considering the treatment my own tool has seen by the Node organization as of late.  It seems to me that either many of the views expressed previously with regard to privacy and other tools be deemed invalid or we apply that same logic to EVERY other tool listed in the docs, and as such, approve this PR to remove said links.
<issue_comment>username_5: @username_3 @cjihrig @username_2 isn't this obsolete?
<issue_comment>username_3: I'm going to close it, but it can be re-opened if OP (or anyone else) wants to rebase to get rid of the conflicts, etc."
