username_0: **Disclaimer: The following is a personal contribution, and does not necessarily reflect the views of GitHub, my employer.**

A code of conduct is important because it promotes moral behavior, acts as a guideline for ethical decision making, enhances the reputation of an organization, prevents negative legal effects, encourages positive relationships, acts as a reference for solving ethical dilemmas and prevents discrimination or harassment.

Harassment and abuse are significant factors in preventing the entire community of tech companies, user groups, open source projects, and other organizations and events from being truly diverse and welcoming to participation.

Also, a well-written code of conduct clarifies an organization's mission, values and principles, linking them with standards of professional conduct. 

This aligns well with this project's inferred mission of helping people becoming better programmers and software professionals.

@sdmg15 as this repository' maintainer, you are setting the example for thousands of other developers.

<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 have created a draft markdown file for blog.md for Docusaurus v2, am reviewing it and would raise a PR soon. I have shared the same with you on Discord. Your inputs on any modifications required are most welcome.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_3 sure, will do by this week
<issue_comment>username_0: hey @username_3 i've read through the draft and it's looking great, plz go ahead and PR this in :]
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 have raised a [PR](https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1786) on this.
<issue_comment>username_2: Currently, it's not so obvious what are the available themeConfig option for `@docusaurus/theme-classic`. We should document it https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/master/packages/docusaurus-theme-classic

Example: https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/pull/1909/files
<issue_comment>username_3: If I'm not wrong we need to augment the existing documentation for [using-themes](docusaurus/website/docs/using-themes.md) for v2 to add details about themeConfig option for @docusaurus/theme-classic right?
<issue_comment>username_2: You can start editing https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/theme-classic for the theme config. I have provided an example
<issue_comment>username_3: Sure thing.
<issue_comment>username_4: From what I'm reading it seems like the Infima framework powering v2 is not yet public? I'm trying to figure out the best way to override globals (fonts), and while I see how to override the coloring scheme, I am unable to find a full list of `--ifm-` variables. Is there anywhere I could find these? Also, how should I be directly accessing the document <head> to pull in customizations like Google Fonts? Do I setup my own theme to override the classic-theme?
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_4 how about trying https://v2.docusaurus.io/docs/docusaurus.config.js#stylesheets
<issue_comment>username_4: Yeah that would definitely allow me to import different styles, however that's not really my concern. I could probably hack in some `!important` statements inside the custom css stylesheet --- just trying to find the most elegant solution. Is there a full list of `--ifm-` variables anywhere? The [Infima](https://infima-dev.netlify.com/) doesn't look to have the docs ready. Thanks for the help regardless. There is some pretty cool stuff being done within this project!
<issue_comment>username_5: Is it possible to support @ material-ui / styles of material-uiÔºü
<issue_comment>username_6: @username_5 mind elaborating more?
<issue_comment>username_5: Using @ material-ui/styles on the server side requires additional processing, and the converted style needs to be entered into the html string.

<issue_comment>username_5: Thank you for your timely reply. Will you consider doing this support?
<issue_comment>username_6: Please file a separate issue, this issue is not the right place to discuss about it. We are shorthanded at the moment but maybe external contributors might help out.
<issue_comment>username_5: Thank you for your reply.üò¨
<issue_comment>username_6: I was browsing the pages at https://v2.docusaurus.io and I felt that the docs were very complete and hence I came to look at this issue and just realized that this issue is already 95% done! Amazing work @username_0 and the others!
<issue_comment>username_6: Our docs are in a much better place now compared to a year ago. There are some TODOs left in the code, but I'll clear them up. Closing this issue! Thanks again @username_0! ‚ù§Ô∏è<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_7: Hey, I would like to help !!  are there any tasks left I can work on? @username_0

username_0: Hi people,

I miss a simple functionality in Full Node bitcoin-qt and bitcoind, that retains the last goal of node.
Due to slowly consolidation of the last blocks validation before the first time free run of the node, expending several days or weeks, I need to improvise with a crontab cron job of
$ cat ~/.bitcoin/blocks/blk000*.dat > ~/.bitcoin/bootstrap.dat.
Even when the option -reindex-chainstate directly into bitcoind, it's was unable to restart at last block validated shutting the block mapping again and again to 2009, in case of stop, crash or power failure.

Best regards.
<issue_comment>username_1: so after an improper shutdown of the node, you lose all the block history since you last started the node.  is that what you are describing?  that's happened to me a few times.  i started to manually shutdown and restart weekly to avoid the issue.  i'm hoping moving to version 0.21.0 fixes the issue
