Most liquidity: Users get access to substantial liquidity for swaps across dozens of connected sources. Currently, 50+ sources are available on Ethereum and 20+ on BSC.

Private key and seed phrase scanning: You can easily import wallets by scanning a private key string or seed phrase with a phone camera directly in the app. The feature is powered by AI.

Push notifications: You can approve transactions on your devices, including Apple Watch, without having to log into the 1inch Wallet every time.

[kubelet-check] Initial timeout of 40s passed.

Unfortunately, an error has occurred:
        timed out waiting for the condition

This error is likely caused by:
        - The kubelet is not running
        - The kubelet is unhealthy due to a misconfiguration of the node in some way (required cgroups disabled)

If you are on a systemd-powered system, you can try to troubleshoot the error with the following commands:
        - 'systemctl status kubelet'
        - 'journalctl -xeu kubelet'

Additionally, a control plane component may have crashed or exited when started by the container runtime.
To troubleshoot, list all containers using your preferred container runtimes CLI, e.g. docker.
Here is one example how you may list all Kubernetes containers running in docker:
        - 'docker ps -a | grep kube | grep -v pause'
        Once you have found the failing container, you can inspect its logs with:
        - 'docker logs CONTAINERID'
error execution phase wait-control-plane: couldn't initialize a Kubernetes cluster

Can someone please help??
