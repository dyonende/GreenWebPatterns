<issue_comment>username_0: Medium is great but the site would get more traffic since the blog posts are all hosted in the same place.

It also allows for more customization like an email newsletter section at the bottom of every blog post.

We could also automate the sharing of blog posts and events so that anytime there is a new one created, it will take the updated RSS feed and can share to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
<issue_comment>username_0: Users are also more likely to explore rest of Techqueria website since they are not leaving the site for Medium.

username_0: Currently `.Render` is the only way to benefit from the content directory template logic (based on section/type) with partial templates.
But `.Render` requires a Page context and cannot cache its produced markup (√† la `partialCache`).

User can devise a way to replicate this complex template inheritance for its partials using `templates.Exists` etc... but I wonder if Hugo could not sport the feature with minimum if no code breaks at all.

### Basic example
```
layouts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _default
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄsingle.html
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ list.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ recipes
‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ single.html
‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ partials
‚îÇ        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sidebar.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ partials
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sidebar.html
```

With the above layout directory, user could use the same partial call `{{ partial sidebar.html }}` from both `_default/single.html` and `recipes/single.html` and let Hugo check for the existence of an ""overriding"" partial.

I'm merely bringing this up to start a discussion for it is hard for me, as a user, to grasp its technical complexity.
<issue_comment>username_1: I guess this would be ... possible somehow. But in my head, this is what we have base templates for. Admittedly we should improve the ""lookup logic"" in that area (there is an issue about that somewhere), but I think that if you want to make an argument for the value of this particular feature, I think you need to come up with a better example than a sidebar (which I think fits much better in the `baseof.html` setting).
<issue_comment>username_1: Also, I don't think you would get ""the same template inheritance logic as `.Render`"" without a ... page; that `.Render` cannot determine its layout without knowing the page.
<issue_comment>username_0: Oh yes.... Didn't think about that. It would mean the partial call somehow must guess which section (directory) to look for. Can't think of any safe way for this to be guessed when `partial` is used.

It's a shame, I would love to see the power of `partialCache` brought to any template file.
<issue_comment>username_1: As I said, what would probably be possible is to use the partial that lives in the ""current template section"" (I made that up). e.g. `recipes/single.html` => `recipes/partial/foo.html`.
<issue_comment>username_0: Indeed, wouldn't this get too complicated if partial is used inside of another partial ? Having to navigate back to the initial template file's location?
I think shortcodes use the template logic of regular template files, so I suppose if the ""root"" template file found is a shortcode, you could identify the directory?"

javascript made to have this small things. you can bookmark pages by inserting which recipie you want lets say by insert a cookie or whatever :) you can use ""window.history.back();"" you can even click a button and you can resize another thing.

in my video I created the ""be inside of a book"" rexpirence I always wanted this project allowed me to do it!
I was thinking we can have it like Winamp where everyone can create his own Plugins and shit ain't it be cool ?
we will have a blank page and we will have a userscript community. and everyone can create their own thing even the soyboys their own html5 crappy theme for if they wish and the site will be a blank page

This is an acceptable edge case IMO since once we're out of beta we won't have to check for the beta flag.
- ~~For now, I switched to a hackish method of redirecting from the index page to the dashboard - see the bottom <script> element on that index.md. The thing is that we currently need an immediate method of checking whether or not a user is enrolled in the beta to redirect from the homepage to the dashboard, because sometimes that /v0/user route takes awhile, and we need a redirect to be fast. For testing purposes, I added a flag into localStorage that enables beta features for the site which we can use to check immediately~~
<issue_comment>username_0: @bshyong I actually feel great about this current solution. Once we go from beta to live, we may need to revise the redirect handler, but otherwise I think it's in great shape. No sessionStorage or localStorage necessary. You just need to enroll the user in the beta by visiting `http://localhost:3001/dashboard-beta/` or the profile."

username_0: We want many millions of people in Germany to install the app, right? To achieve this the landing page needs a much easier-to-understand language.

One example:
When looking at the german version of the website, one of the first senteces that the user reads is: ""Das Exposure Notification Framework (von Apple und Google) auf einem mobilen Ger√§t sendet einen Rolling Proximity Identifier und sucht gleichzeitig regelm√§√üig mithilfe der Technologie Bluetooth Low Energy nach IDs anderer Smartphones und speichert die IDs lokal.""

How many percent of people in Germany are able to understand this?

Don't forget that the challenge is not to develop this app, but rather to bring it onto the smartphones of about 50 million people in germany. So the marketing team should be larger than the development team.

Is there any strategy for that already in place?

the idea for coronawarn.app is to get in contact with developers, tech freaks and people interested in the progress of the open source project. The target group of coronawarn.app is definitively not the broad population of Germany.
A separate PR campaign will be set up with the target to get a huge adoption.
I think the language is OK for the group we are targeting with coronawarn.app.
