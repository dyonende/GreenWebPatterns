It's like that nasty ` copy` to ` copy 2` thing OSX does.

I don't think there is a standard between operating systems/apps for the naming convention of duplicated files, so I'm not sure why trying to adhere to one here makes sense.

It seems fine to use https://github.com/username_2/unused-filename to do this, but unused-filename doesn't offer customizing. Would you consider adding the ability to customize to unused-filename?
<issue_comment>username_2: ""Stupid/nasty"" is not a constructive argument. The parens make it clearer that the number is not part of the filename.
<issue_comment>username_0: Thanks @username_1 :)

Hello @username_2, I made the delimiter configurable because there were different opinions about the convention to use in the issue's discussion. 

Nevertheless, I am available to define a default behavior if it is the best option. I can also change the 'increment' option name to another name that is clearer for the user. 

I didn't know the [unused-filename](https://github.com/username_2/unused-filename) project. I will check it when possible.
<issue_comment>username_1: ""XYZ isn't constructive"" is literally the least-constructive/most-overused phrase in FOSS. Please inspect the meaning of comments before accusing them of being nonconstructive.

""it looks stupid/nasty"" was a light-hearted way of saying some people don't like that ""convention"" (aka: non-existent OS standard) and would just like the ability to customize it to their tastes.

Again, no one cares if you make parens (or whatever) the default (in fact, it's probably a good idea to for unused-filename to [default to OS-specific conventions](https://github.com/username_2/unused-filename/issues/3)), we'd just like to be empowered to customize more things and less purism -- unless there's a good reason for the purism which I'm happy to hear about.

I'll bow out of this PR now since I'm afraid further discussion will detract from @username_0 good work.
<issue_comment>username_2: Any suggestion? Maybe `overwrite` and with `true` by default.

But I\'m excited about this page and plan on working on it more later this week/end if there\'s still work to be done. The major things left are:\r\n- [x] Hook up typed search to the query param (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeSearch/pull/38)\r\n- [x] ~Sending a _second_ search for the `@types/` / non-`@types` version of a module, depending on what the user searches, and turn the list of `@types/` packages into a `Set<string>` to inform the `definitelyTyped` prop of `HitResult`~ Looks like Algolia actually does have the types support data in its results? -> Yes! Resolved in 5d966e30.\r\n- [x] Add the npm/yarn/pnpm selector\r\n    - [x] Store it in localStorage\r\n- [x] Format the results rows nicely 💅  _(and add the ""Powered by Algolia"" notice)_\r\n    - [x] General layout/fonts\r\n    - [x] Colors & image styling\r\n    - [x] Time recency\r\n    - [x] Mobile responsiveness\r\n    - [x] Use a ~markdown~ quick regex parser to convert package descriptions to plaintext\r\n- [x] Add an initial search on the page\r\n    - [ ] Figure out what that initial search should be\r\n- [x] General QA and miscellaneous resultant bug fixes\r\n    - [x] Potential crash: querying for `reactrer` shows a `description` equal to `null` \r\n\r\n**Update 9/3** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/username_0/status/1301752211475759105)): Mostly done with the basic logic; still needs some touchups and quality polish.\r\n\r\n**Update 9/4** Should be ready for review!

username_0: Started from pairing with @username_1 over Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/729447355 on these [Figma designs](https://www.figma.com/file/x8FJrNqj6oupqWn1s3uMg4/Website?node-id=1113%3A0).

**Initial notes (9/2)**: I decided to take Orta's advice and stop midway through implementing it, and get a good night's sleep instead 😄. But I'm excited about this page and plan on working on it more later this week/end if there's still work to be done. The major things left are:
- [x] Hook up typed search to the query param (https://github.com/microsoft/TypeSearch/pull/38)
- [x] ~Sending a _second_ search for the `@types/` / non-`@types` version of a module, depending on what the user searches, and turn the list of `@types/` packages into a `Set<string>` to inform the `definitelyTyped` prop of `HitResult`~ Looks like Algolia actually does have the types support data in its results? -> Yes! Resolved in 5d966e30.
- [x] Add the npm/yarn/pnpm selector
    - [x] Store it in localStorage
- [x] Format the results rows nicely 💅  _(and add the ""Powered by Algolia"" notice)_
    - [x] General layout/fonts
    - [x] Colors & image styling
    - [x] Time recency
    - [x] Mobile responsiveness
    - [x] Use a ~markdown~ quick regex parser to convert package descriptions to plaintext
- [x] Add an initial search on the page
    - [ ] Figure out what that initial search should be
- [x] General QA and miscellaneous resultant bug fixes
    - [x] Potential crash: querying for `reactrer` shows a `description` equal to `null` 

**Update 9/3** ([tweet](https://twitter.com/username_0/status/1301752211475759105)): Mostly done with the basic logic; still needs some touchups and quality polish.

**Update 9/4** Should be ready for review! I've played with it a bunch and am happy so far with it. The remaining questions I have are:
* What should initial homepage search query be?
* What should the ""no results found"" indicator be? _(read: is this silly placeholder logo variant the right kind of silly?)_

<issue_comment>username_1: haha, that no results, cloning and trying locally
<issue_comment>username_1: I've applied all my feedback inline directly (dark mode, some UX / copy changes), this is pretty much shippable right now.

I do have an unresolved question: What do you think the interaction pattern for linking to the source for the DTS should be? e.g. I'm looking at this:

![Screen Shot 2020-09-05 at 5 25 03 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49038/92313689-8562c200-ef9c-11ea-9354-163feef527a2.png)
 
And I want to go to the async dep, should:

 - make just the title an anchor?
 - support clicking o the row in any section other than the code?
 - other?
<issue_comment>username_0: Yeah that's a good question... how about this:

* DLs: link to npm
* Via: link to the GitHub source, as the GH repository for built-in and the DefinitelyTyped repository
* Module > name: link to npm

Everything else _feels_ like non-link plain text to me...

Additionally, as @danvk mentioned, it'd be great to have the install commands copy & pasteable, like on npmjs.com.
<issue_comment>username_1: OK, I've given it an Intl pass, and handled my own on the DT link.

Re: copy, I'm alright with this technique, it conceptually playground links happen in the code samples

username_0: The section implementation thinks that:

 * I have a million sections, one per date
 * `/pl/pl/blog` is a good thing (it isn’t!)

<issue_comment>username_1: What options did you use to create those URLs?
<issue_comment>username_0: Nothing special.

```py
TRANSLATIONS = {
    DEFAULT_LANG: """",
    # Example for another language:
    ""pl"": ""./pl"",
}
POSTS = ((""posts/*.rst"", ""blog"", ""post.tmpl""),
         (""posts/*.ipynb"", ""blog"", ""post.tmpl""))
```

Plus `posts/2014/08/01/foo.rst` as input file.<issue_closed>
<issue_comment>username_0: Seems to work fine.

I have a section usage question: if I enable sections from meta data, what do I get and where? Where do the section pages go? Can I keep my existing /blog/ URL structure and yet have sections?
<issue_comment>username_1: Metadata-powered sections still create their indexes in /section-slug/index.html|atom. Post addresses are unmodified. So you can indeed keep your URLs and get new sections. Right now, you have one auto-section called ""blog"". Enabling metadata section would put every post in the uncategorized section.
<issue_comment>username_0: Awesome!

    sed 's/.. category/.. section//'
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 you can still use post.section_color() (for headlines? a border or other small UI?) and .post.section_link() for (breadcrumb navigation (top -> section name)?)  in your theme.
<issue_comment>username_0: will try that, too"
