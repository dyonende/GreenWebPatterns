username_0: This is was an issue opened on the nodejs/node repository before guides were transferred directly to node/nodejs.org.

This PR contains a first go at a guide on backpressures, and missing some vital points that I do not feel equipped to answer. I have left some empty spaces for them! I would appreciate anyone's input on the content, structure, and any additions to the guide.

Some points to expand on would be the problems that streams pose which are solved by backpressure. I think I hit most of the points, but I don't think I'm versed enough to go into detail.

There is also space for an example app, but again, I am not familiar on the current best practices on building streams and for implementing your own backpressure.

<issue_comment>username_0: Sorry for the static on this! I took a look back on this, realized some grammar was off and fixed some  formatting.

Added in a few pointers mentioned earlier in the thread, though they didn't necessarily close off all the reviews.

Skimmed out the example application because I felt that was redundant since there are a rich supply of examples found in the documentation, and I didn't want to reinvent the wheel. 

I only have one question and that's in regards to the implementation of a Writable stream. Are there any mistakes one can make in `_write()` or `_writev()` that would damage backpressure? They seem like pretty foolproof functions to me.

Should the guide extend its scope and talk about creating a custom writable wtream from scratch then? As in:

```
MyWritable.prototype.write = function(chunk, enc, cb) {
  // code that respects return value here
}

util.inherits(MyWritable, Stream);
```

Thanks for all the help! Hope to land this soon!
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_0 `_writev` goes in combination with `.cork()`, and it is especially useful if we are writing to a stream directly. The biggest mistake is this pattern:

```js
ws.cork()
ws.write('hello ')
ws.write('world ')
ws.uncork()

ws.cork()
ws.write('from ')
ws.write('Matteo')
ws.uncork()
```

This will cause two transfers into C++ realm, making the use of cork() a bit useless the correct pattern is:

```js
ws.cork()
ws.write('hello ')
ws.write('world ')
process.nextTick(doUncork, ws)

ws.cork()
ws.write('from ')
ws.write('Matteo')
process.nextTick(doUncork, ws)

// as a global function
function doUncork (stream) {
  stream.uncork()
}
```

`cork()` can be called as many times we want, we just need to be careful to call `uncork()` the same amount of times to make it flow again.

Also, many of the index files are placeholders and I don't think we care about adding a description to those - though I haven't verified that. Just for the record, when there is no description field, when the site is generated, jekyll grabs the first paragraph of the text to use as the description. The first paragraph of many pages includes links, which ends up inserting an ""illegal"" link into the metadata.

Just add a description. :D

username_0: https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/user-timings

We should have metrics and telemetry for performance of our site. That way we can have more insight into if we're messing up mobile users or users with older browsers, etc.

In particular, if we are going to target mobile links (rural areas) which are characterized as ""long fat pipes) we need to 
  (a) reduce payload size [cost, not necessarily speed...but maybe speed on 2g]
  (b) avoid round-trips [latency is much higher on mobile links], especially serialized round-trips on APIs
  (c) expect older browsers on low-powered devices meaning careful about assuming JS is fast and that large DOMs are okay because JS on ARM phones can be abysmally slow (esp on old versions of browsers) and memory is obviously smaller.

I notice the locale for your page's test is Dulles VA. The other gateway is

Boom works by just downloading the raw page (no images or other associated files). It's mostly good as a way of getting a sense of how long it takes to get a connection. webpagetest.org on the other hand renders the whole page in a virtual browser, so it's better for getting a sense how long it will take for users to see the page.

At my old company we did a ""tech huddle"" every Monday to go over the numbers: how many 500s, how long is the longest DB transaction, etc. and then make tickets if anything got worse.

Making a script for webpagetest.org shouldn't be too hard. Once you have a key you can run `curl ""http://www.webpagetest.org/runtest.php?url=https://www.vets.gov&f=json&k=KEY""` and you'll get a response like

```json
{
        ""data"": {
                ""detailCSV"": ""http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160628_33_10RF/requests.csv"",
                ""jsonUrl"": ""http://www.webpagetest.org/jsonResult.php?test=160628_33_10RF"",
                ""ownerKey"": ""747ffe160351d5dfb49a8d5fb75776c81827eaba"",
                ""summaryCSV"": ""http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160628_33_10RF/page_data.csv"",
                ""testId"": ""160628_33_10RF"",
                ""userUrl"": ""http://www.webpagetest.org/result/160628_33_10RF/"",
                ""xmlUrl"": ""http://www.webpagetest.org/xmlResult/160628_33_10RF/""
        },
        ""statusCode"": 200,
        ""statusText"": ""Ok""
}
```

Then if you grab data.jsonUrl, you get the full data trace with all the timing info we'd need.
<issue_comment>username_2: james pls. move to dev ops repo:)
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_2, dev ops is working on collecting information on time to first byte and response latency, but I think this is still relevant for the google analytics integration and collecting timing information (DOM load, first paint) from the client's perspective.

Can you point me to who's got details on the GA integration?

Closes #47. Read up on that issue if you want to know how this has come to be.\r\n\r\nThis PR unlocks the ability to internationalize our website to a number of languages. Main changes are as follows:\r\n\r\n* Added the `RainLab.Translate` plugin for OctoberCMS, allowing for translations;\r\n* Created a custom `GodotEngine.Utility` plugin to extend the functionality of the Translate plugin to suit our needs;\r\n* Covered almost all existing pages making texts translatable (with a couple of exceptions, see below);\r\n* Partially translated those pages to Russian (mostly to test things, but the translations are proper);\r\n* Added a locale switcher to the footer.\r\n\r\n**Commits are purposefully unsquashed.** I hope this would allow to check the code and the layouts easier. There is a lot to check and I\'ve tried to make commits as concise and related to one subject as possible. Be advised, though, that though I\'ve tried to address all of the technical details in the first few commits, some issues arose later on. I\'ve tried to keep things separate as much as possible still.\r\n\r\n### How does it work?\r\n\r\nThe system is two-fold. RainLab.Translate provides the low level tools for translations to be applied to the texts. Unfortunately, this plugin operates on an internal database while we prefer to keep translations in files so that they can be maintained via Weblate. The Translate plugin supports files, but only CSV (via import) and YAML (via scanning). We rely on YAML files as the only reasonable way to automate things.\r\n\r\nHowever, actual translations are kept in PO files, as is the longstanding tradition when translating Godot resources. Those PO files are generated from the actual template code of the website using GodotEngine.Utility. They can then be moved anywhere outside of the system, edited and re-added. As RainLab.Translate is not able to handle PO files directly, we use them to generate YAML files. The Translate plugin happily scans them and adds translated strings. The rest is controlled by it.\r\n\r\nTo enforce a language on a page the path of a URL is used. For example, `https://godotengine.org/features` can be translated into Russian by changing the URL to `https://godotengine.org/ru/features`. On the subsequent requests to the website the locale is remembered and kept, even if the URL is not containing the locale code. These links can be cached by search engines. We may need to think about how we want to handle that. At the very least, canonical meta-tags are required.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned before, there is now the locale selector at the bottom of each page. So manual editing of URLs is not needed.\r\n\r\n### How to translate the website?\r\n\r\nCompared to the approach described in the linked issue things got a bit simpler. Text still needs to be wrapped in a particular construct, however it\'s just one function call. There is a small extra detail here: as we are using PHP, single quotation marks are pretty powerless, and double quotation marks are ""magical"". This is utilized in the following manner:\r\n\r\n* For single lines of texts (buttons, headers, etc) use a single quotation mark: `{{ TR(\'Some text\') }}`;\r\n* For multiline statements, especially containing markup and formatting, use a double quotation mark: `{{ TR(""Some text"") }}`.\r\n\r\nHere\'s the example from the actual code:\r\n\r\n```twig\r\n      <h2>{{ TR(\'The game engine you waited&nbsp;for.\') }}</h2>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        {{ TR(""\r\n        Godot provides a huge set of common tools, so you can just focus on\r\n        making your game without reinventing the wheel.\r\n        "") }}\r\n      </p>\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically, this is it.

username_0: Now, this is a big one. Closes #47. Read up on that issue if you want to know how this has come to be.

This PR unlocks the ability to internationalize our website to a number of languages. Main changes are as follows:

* Added the `RainLab.Translate` plugin for OctoberCMS, allowing for translations;
* Created a custom `GodotEngine.Utility` plugin to extend the functionality of the Translate plugin to suit our needs;
* Covered almost all existing pages making texts translatable (with a couple of exceptions, see below);
* Partially translated those pages to Russian (mostly to test things, but the translations are proper);
* Added a locale switcher to the footer.

**Commits are purposefully unsquashed.** I hope this would allow to check the code and the layouts easier. There is a lot to check and I've tried to make commits as concise and related to one subject as possible. Be advised, though, that though I've tried to address all of the technical details in the first few commits, some issues arose later on. I've tried to keep things separate as much as possible still.

### How does it work?

The system is two-fold. RainLab.Translate provides the low level tools for translations to be applied to the texts. Unfortunately, this plugin operates on an internal database while we prefer to keep translations in files so that they can be maintained via Weblate. The Translate plugin supports files, but only CSV (via import) and YAML (via scanning). We rely on YAML files as the only reasonable way to automate things.

However, actual translations are kept in PO files, as is the longstanding tradition when translating Godot resources. Those PO files are generated from the actual template code of the website using GodotEngine.Utility. They can then be moved anywhere outside of the system, edited and re-added. As RainLab.Translate is not able to handle PO files directly, we use them to generate YAML files. The Translate plugin happily scans them and adds translated strings. The rest is controlled by it.

To enforce a language on a page the path of a URL is used. For example, `https://godotengine.org/features` can be translated into Russian by changing the URL to `https://godotengine.org/ru/features`. On the subsequent requests to the website the locale is remembered and kept, even if the URL is not containing the locale code. These links can be cached by search engines. We may need to think about how we want to handle that. At the very least, canonical meta-tags are required.

As mentioned before, there is now the locale selector at the bottom of each page. So manual editing of URLs is not needed.

### How to translate the website?

Compared to the approach described in the linked issue things got a bit simpler. Text still needs to be wrapped in a particular construct, however it's just one function call. There is a small extra detail here: as we are using PHP, single quotation marks are pretty powerless, and double quotation marks are ""magical"". This is utilized in the following manner:

* For single lines of texts (buttons, headers, etc) use a single quotation mark: `{{ TR('Some text') }}`;
* For multiline statements, especially containing markup and formatting, use a double quotation mark: `{{ TR(""Some text"") }}`.

Here's the example from the actual code:

```twig
      <h2>{{ TR('The game engine you waited&nbsp;for.') }}</h2>

      <p>
        {{ TR(""
        Godot provides a huge set of common tools, so you can just focus on
        making your game without reinventing the wheel.
        "") }}
      </p>
```

Technically, this is it. Though one has to remember to escape single and double quotes in the corresponding strings (with a backslash).

```twig
    {{ TR(""
    By joining Godot communities, you agree to follow Godot's
    <a href=\""/code-of-conduct\"">Code of Conduct</a>.
    "") }}
```

### How to work with PO files?

To generate PO files a locale must exist. To add a new locale use the admin panel (*Translate > Manage Languages*). This step cannot be automated as it must be performed on the actual database. To generate the necessary files, use the following command: `php artisan godotengine:addi18n es` (where `es` is the code for the locale; it must match with the code entered in the admin panel).

```shell
root@28925d7870fb:/var/www/html# php artisan godotengine:addi18n es
Adding ""es"" translation.
Writing translation PO file themes/godotengine/i18n/po/messages.es.po.
Writing translation YAML file themes/godotengine/i18n/es.yaml.
Updating Theme configuration.
Successfully added ""es"" translation.
```

PO files are updated using another command: `php artisan godotengine:extracti18n` (no arguments). This command scans Twig templates for the calls to the aforementioned `TR` function and extracts all calls using string literals for arguments. Firstly, a base file is generated anew. Then this file is merged using `msgmerge` with the PO file for each locale. That's it, the resulting PO files can be edited. `msgmerge` tries to fuzzy map similar messages too, so small changes to the original lines can be propagated through translations without any loss of values.

```shell
root@28925d7870fb:/var/www/html# php artisan godotengine:extracti18n
Starting message extraction.
Scanning Layout files.
Scanning Page files.
Scanning Partial files.
Merging extracted messages with the current base file.

........ done.
Successfully updated ""ru"" translation; file themes/godotengine/i18n/po/messages.ru.po has been written.
Finished message extraction.
```

[Truncated]

6. The titles of the most pages are translated automagically, because they match the strings already present in the system. But for the downloads page, at least, I've had to come up with a way to change it to a translated variant via some use of placeholders:

```swift
{% put head_title %}{{ TR('Download') ~ ' | Linux' }}{% endput %}
```

This can be applied to any page that requires adjustments. But, like I've said, it mostly *just works*:

```swift
<title>Godot Engine - {% placeholder head_title default %}{{ TR(this.page.title) }}{% endplaceholder %}</title>
```

username_0: See #7329.

Here is my particular case of ""paired shortcodes"":

```
{{< section >}}

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam efficitur luctus hendrerit. Nullam nunc massa, placerat non pharetra sit amet, facilisis sed est. Proin convallis arcu eget blandit accumsan.

Etiam eu metus nec est consectetur efficitur a sed eros. Proin nec fermentum metus. Ut vulputate erat ante, a egestas purus mollis eu. Donec porttitor lacus elementum, laoreet odio in, mollis odio. Proin dui libero, bibendum eu dapibus in, lobortis a sapien.

Nulla condimentum turpis nibh, sit amet rhoncus dui sodales sit amet. Vestibulum tincidunt tempor magna, in pellentesque quam rhoncus eu. Nam gravida metus et elit mollis, at posuere mauris venenatis.

{{< section />}}
```

This is a partial fix, because there is a catch. (There is always a catch.) Two, in fact.

**I)**

```
{{% mdshortcode %}}Stuff to `process` in the *center*.{{% /mdshortcode %}}
```

Shortcodes defined with `%` may ""escape"" some of the closing HTML tags in one or more templates. Don't ask me how this happens — I don't know.

**II)**

From:

```
{{< highlight go >}} A bunch of code here {{< /highlight >}}
```

To:

```
{{< highlight go >}} A bunch of code here {{< highlight />}}
```

The closing slash must be moved from before `highlight` (as described in the documentation) to before the right angle bracket. To leave the slash where it is may cause precisely the same fatal error as before.

The reasons for these strange phenomena are not clear to me, as I have no prior experience with Go in any capacity whatsoever.

You are welcome to do whatever you want with this code, @username_1, but don't tell me that my problems don't real.
<issue_comment>username_1: If you can add a failing test case that this PR fixes it would be easier to understand; I also need that before I can consider merging this.
<issue_comment>username_0: I would do as you request, but just let me show you something.

With my commit and the following shortcode template:

```html
<div class=""flex-l mv0 pa3 center"">
    <article class=""center mw7"">
        <div class=""nested-copy-line-height lh-copy f6 nested-links nested-img mid-gray"">
            {{ .Get 0 }}
        </div>
    </article>
</div>
```

...This in `_index.md`:

```
{{% section %}}

testing 1 2 3

{{% section /%}}
```

...Produces the following generated output:

```html
<pre>
    <code>    </div>
    </article>
    </code>
</pre>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>testing 1 2 3</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<pre>
    <code>    </div>
    </article>
    </code>
</pre>
```

Why is this? I have no idea.

While this in `_index.md`:

```
{{< section >}}

# This is a headline

## The is a subheadline

*This is italicized text.*

**This is bolded text.**

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Etiam efficitur luctus
hendrerit. Nullam nunc massa, placerat non pharetra sit amet, facilisis sed est.
Proin convallis arcu eget blandit accumsan. Morbi volutpat elit ac nibh
porttitor tristique. Duis congue pellentesque sem et convallis. Etiam eu metus

{{< section />}}
```

...Works as expected, formatting and all, while this:

```
{{% section %}}

testing 1 2 3

{{% /section %}}
```
[Truncated]
...Both produce the following build error:

```
Building sites … ERROR [DATE AND TIME] Unable to locate template for shortcode """" in page ""_index.md""
Built in 177 ms
Error: Error building site: logged 1 error(s)
```

Without my commit, variations with the slash before the name of the shortcode produce the following build error:

```
Built in 70 ms
Error: Error building site: ""[...]/content/_index.md:xx:yy"": failed to extract shortcode: shortcode "">}}"" has no .Inner, yet a closing tag was provided
```

...And variations with the slash before the right angle bracket produce the stack trace described in issue #7322.

I'm sure that this is a very simple parsing problem, but it is no less an impenetrable mystery to me. I simply do not have the domain-specific knowledge — of the language or of the project — to even begin to untangle this.

I've taken this as far as I can. If you or another guru o' Hugo don't know why these things be like it is, then I guess no one understands what the **** is happening here.
<issue_comment>username_1: The formatting question you raise is documented and has nothing to do with the ""crash"". You cannot copy a fraction of a big site and tell me that ""this case fails"" when there are millions of similar working examples out there. I'm not doubting that the problem is real, but the devil is in the detail -- we need a failing test to be able to fix this.
<issue_comment>username_0: Is parsing behavior dependent on site and/or theme configuration?

Under what conditions does Hugo consider an unhandled (fatal) exception to be an acceptable outcome?

I have observed this behavior on the following versions:

* hugo_0.71.1_macOS-64bit
* hugo_0.71.1_macOS-32bit
* hugo_0.70.0_macOS-32bit
* hugo_extended_0.71.1_macOS-64bit
* hugo_extended_0.70.0_macOS-64bit
* hugo_0.70.0_macOS-64bit
* hugo_extended_0.68.3_macOS-64bit
* hugo_extended_0.63.2_macOS-64bit
* hugo_0.63.1_macOS-64bit

The last version to correctly parse the name of a shortcode was `v0.61.0`.

Are or are not these messages evidence of parsing error?

```
Building sites … ERROR [DATE AND TIME] Unable to locate template for shortcode """" in page ""_index.md""
```

```
Error: Error building site: ""[...]/content/_index.md:xx:yy"": failed to extract shortcode: shortcode "">}}"" has no .Inner, yet a closing tag was provided
```

Should the ellipsis in `shortcode ""...""` not name the shortcode used, e.g., `youtube`, `figure`, or `section`?

Thank you for your time.
<issue_comment>username_0: As a user, I like Hugo a lot.

As a guru, Hugo's shortcode parsing mechanism is too verbose to be understood by mortal man.

To help alleviate this problem, I have conceived the kernel of a parsing mechanism that is thick, solid, tight — as well as a number of other unspecified but highly positive attributes.

I begin by defining the pattern of a well-formed shortcode as a regular expression.

This pattern is compiled to a finite automaton named `scRex`. It consists of five parts: `ftype`, `name`, `posi`, `keyw`, and `etypf`.

In addition to `scRex`, there is an automaton named `scLooseRex`, which is used to capture the set of identifiable shortcodes, well- and ill-formed both.

```golang
// `scRex` is the regular expression automaton that matches all valid shortcode
// variant forms, including simple, paired, and self-closing. A paired shortcode
// is like a div tag, and usually has inner content, e.g., `<div>alpha bravo
// charlie</div>`; a simple shortcode is like an img tag, e.g., `<img
// src=""sauce.jpg"" />`; and a self-closing shortcode is like a paired tag made
// singular, with no inner content, e.g., `div i=""1"" ii=""2"" iii=3 />.
// The structure of a shortcode has five parts, two of them optional. They are:
// ftype: the opening token of a shortcode; specifies the formatting type of the
//        inner content (if any)
// name: the name of the shortcode; corresponds to the template
// posi: positional parameters passed to the template, if any
// keyw: keyword parameters passed to the template, if any
// epytf: the terminating token of the shortcode
var ftype =  `(?P<ftype>{{[<%])[ \t]+`
var name = `/?(?P<name>[-\w]+)[ \t]+`
var posi =   `(?P<posi>(?:\w+[ \t]+)+)?`
var keyw = strings.Join([]string{
    `(?P<keyw>(?:\w+=(?:`,
    `\w+`,                       // 1. Captures word-type unquoted content.
    `|'[^'\\]*(?:\\.[^'\\]*)*'`, // 2. Captures singly- and doubly-quoted strings,
    `|""[^""\\]*(?:\\.[^""\\]*)*""`, //    including escaped quotation marks of their
    `)[ \t]+)+)?`,               //    respective type.
}, """")
var epytf =  `(?P<epytf>/?[%>]}})`
var scRex = regexp.MustCompile(ftype + name + posi + keyw + epytf)
var scLooseRex = regexp.MustCompile(ftype + `.*?` + epytf)

// Where `scRex` matches both opening and closing tags, `isClosingRex` matches
// closing tags only. The name pattern differs from the former in that the
// leading slash before the name — the indicator of a closing tag — is
// mandatory. It is used solely to determine the ""closing-ness"" of a tag.
var nameIsClosingPattern = `/[-\w]+`
var isClosingPattern = ftype + nameIsClosingPattern
var isClosingRex = regexp.MustCompile(isClosingPattern)
```

`scRex` comes very close to matching all well-formed shortcodes and no others, but to do this with just one pattern would require ""more powerful"" regular expression features than Go support.

```golang
// Used to guarantee that a shortcode has the same leading and trailing ftype.
var validFtypes = []string{""{{<.*?>}}"", ""{{%.*?%}}""}
var validFtypesPattern = strings.Join(validFtypes, ""|"")
var validFtypeRex = regexp.MustCompile(validFtypesPattern)
```

To discriminate between opening, closing, and self-closing shortcodes:

```golang
// Where `scRex` matches both opening and closing tags, `isClosingRex` matches
// closing tags only. The name pattern differs from the former in that the
// leading slash before the name — the indicator of a closing tag — is
// mandatory. It is used solely to determine the ""closing-ness"" of a tag.
var nameIsClosingPattern = `/[-\w]+`
var isClosingPattern = ftype + nameIsClosingPattern
var isClosingRex = regexp.MustCompile(isClosingPattern)

// Matches self-closing shortcodes. In the program logic, self-closing
// shortcodes have a higher priority than ""merely"" closing shortcodes.
var isSelfClosingPattern = `/>}}`
var isSelfClosingRex = regexp.MustCompile(isSelfClosingPattern)
```

Finally we see the expressions used to extract positional and keyword parameters individually:

```golang
// Matches a valid positional parameter.
var extractPosiPattern = `(?P<positional>\w+)[ \t]+`

    fmt.Println(""=== === === ==="")
    fmt.Println(renderPage(content, scs))
    fmt.Println(""=== === === ==="")
    fmt.Println(""=== === === ==="")
}
```

*Et Voilà.*

It is worth saying again that this code is very tight.

*This code is very tight.*

I think it is reasonably idiomatic, but I have spent a total of just a few hours with Go.

In closing, this mechanism is nearly an order of magnitude more terse than what Hugo has currently, and several times more comprehensible.

I believe you will find it very useful indeed.

Please let me know if there is anything you would like to know.
