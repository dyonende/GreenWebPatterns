username_0: You can currently set

```bash
type: pretty
layout: two-colums
```

In every content page, list and single pages. Which makes it flexible. But if you take the base layouts into account, it is hard to create a couple of reusable templates that can be applied to new sections on demand (without creating duplicates):

If I set this in `news/_index.md`:

```bash
type: ""3-column""
```

Then I want that type to be in the template lookup order (before the most general ones) for both that section and other pages in that section.

This means that if I create `news/article.md` I don't have to do something extra to get that ""3-column"" layout.

This behaviour matches what we do with the `section` today, but this will make it more flexible.

So we add

* The current section's type if set
* The root section's type if set

In that order.<issue_closed>
