It's a real world example, with all the complexity that real world examples tend to entail, so feel free to adapt/simplify this example as needed.\r\n\r\nPrior to migration the code looked like this:\r\n```dart\r\n  /// Fetches the image from the asset bundle, decodes it, and returns a\r\n  /// corresponding [ImageInfo] object.\r\n  ///\r\n  /// This function is used by [load].\r\n  @protected\r\n  Future<ui.Codec> _loadAsync(AssetBundleImageKey key, DecoderCallback decode) async {\r\n    ByteData data;\r\n    // Hot reload/restart could change whether an asset bundle or key in a\r\n    // bundle are available, or if it is a network backed bundle.\r\n    try {\r\n      data = await key.bundle.load(key.name);\r\n    } on FlutterError {\r\n      PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.evict(key);\r\n      rethrow;\r\n    }\r\n    if (data == null) { // (1)\r\n      PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.evict(key);\r\n      throw StateError('Unable to read data');\r\n    }\r\n    return await decode(data.buffer.asUint8List()); // (2)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`key.bundle.load` is a method belonging to the Flutter framework that never returns `null`.  However, it might be overridden by a user-provided method, and that method might return null.  So Flutter has a defensive check at (1) to make sure that if that happens, (a) the key gets evicted from the image cache, and (b) the user gets a useful error message.  If they didn't have this defensive code, an exception would be thrown when `data` is accessed at (2), but it would be a less useful error message, and the key wouldn't be properly evicted from the image cache.\r\n\r\nWhen migrating this code, the Flutter folks gave `key.bundle.load` a non-nullable return type, because it's never supposed to return `null`.  And they migrated the `_loadAsync` method like so:\r\n```dart\r\n  /// Fetches the image from the asset bundle, decodes it, and returns a\r\n  /// corresponding [ImageInfo] object.\r\n  ///\r\n  /// This function is used by [load].\r\n  @protected\r\n  Future<ui.Codec> _loadAsync(AssetBundleImageKey key, DecoderCallback decode) async {\r\n    ByteData? data;\r\n    // Hot reload/restart could change whether an asset bundle or key in a\r\n    // bundle are available, or if it is a network backed bundle.\r\n    try {\r\n      data = await key.bundle.load(key.name);\r\n    } on FlutterError {\r\n      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);\r\n      rethrow;\r\n    }\r\n    if (data == null) { // (1)\r\n      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);\r\n      throw StateError('Unable to read data');\r\n    }\r\n    return await decode(data.buffer.asUint8List()); // (2)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this created a problem.  Since `key.bundle.load` has a non-nullable return type, flow analysis reasons that when execution reaches (1), `data` will be non-null, so the body of the `if` statement is dead code; accordingly, the analyzer gives a hint.  Currently it gives a `dead_code` hint, but we're going to change it to something else so that the hint message can point the user to this mixed-mode unsoundness issue (https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/43452).  We might also change it to a warning rather than a hint.\r\n\r\nNow, the analyzer says the body of the `if` statement is dead.  But is it really dead?  What if the user provides their own `key.bundle.load` method and it returns `null`?  If the user's code has null safety enabled, then that can't happen, because a method returning a non-nullable type can't be overridden by a method returning a nullable type.  But if the user's code *doesn't* have null safety enabled yet, there's nothing to stop their method from returning `null`.\r\n\r\nWe think it's really bad if the developer of a framework or package (like Flutter) thinks that a certain code path is impossible due to null safety, but it's actually possible if one of *their* users doesn't have null safety enabled.  So when the compiler compiles the above code, it actually treats it as though it were written like this (or at least, it will as soon as https://dart-review.googlesource.com/c/sdk/+/162004 lands):\r\n\r\n```dart\r\n  /// Fetches the image from the asset bundle, decodes it, and returns a\r\n  /// corresponding [ImageInfo] object.\r\n  ///\r\n  /// This function is used by [load].\r\n  @protected\r\n  Future<ui.Codec> _loadAsync(AssetBundleImageKey key, DecoderCallback decode) async {\r\n    ByteData? data;\r\n    // Hot reload/restart could change whether an asset bundle or key in a\r\n    // bundle are available, or if it is a network backed bundle.\r\n    try {\r\n      data = await key.bundle.load(key.name);\r\n    } on FlutterError {\r\n      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);\r\n      rethrow;\r\n    }\r\n    if (data == null) { // (1)\r\n      throw UnsoundnessError(); // *** ADDED BY THE COMPILER ***\r\n      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);\r\n      throw StateError('Unable to read data');\r\n[Truncated]\n      rethrow;\r\n    }\r\n    if ((data as dynamic) == null) { // (1)\r\n      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);\r\n      throw StateError('Unable to read data');\r\n    }\r\n    return await decode(data.buffer.asUint8List()); // (2)\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding `as dynamic` hides the fact that `data` is non-nullable from flow analysis, so flow analysis no longer notices that it's dead code.  That means that the warning goes away, and the compiler stops inserting a `throw` statement.  So the Flutter developers get to keep their defensive code for the benefit of users that haven't started using null safety yet.\r\n\r\nIn the future, when we get to Dart 3.0 and null safety is required for all code, the defensive code will truly be dead and the Flutter developers will want to get rid of it.  When that happens, we intend to add a lint that will detect the `if ((data as dynamic) == null)` pattern, so that Flutter developers can find cases like this and remove them.\r\n\r\nOk! That's a long detailed example involving an `== null` check.  There are three other cases that could probably use discussion:\r\n- `is` checks\r\n- `??` and `??=` operations\r\n- `?.` and `?..` operations\r\n\r\nI'll dig around and try to find some real-world examples of those.

AFAICT, *all* of the instances of this issue in Flutter use `== null` or `!= null` checks.  I broadened my search to other packages that have been migrated so far, and again found nothing.\r\n\r\nThe only place where I\'ve found examples that didn\'t involve `== null` or `!= null` checks is in the Dart SDK itself, and they\'re not very informative.  For example, this function from `sdk/lib/_internal/js_dev_runtime/private/native_typed_data.dart`:\r\n```dart\r\nvoid _invalidPosition(int position, int length, String name) {\r\n  if (position is! int) {\r\n    throw ArgumentError.value(position, name, \'Invalid list position\');\r\n  } else {\r\n    throw RangeError.range(position, 0, length, name);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe story is pretty much identical to the Flutter example I gave above, except that for some bizarre reason the code is using `if (position is! int)` to trigger the defensive code rather than `if (position == null)`.  Why?  I don\'t know.  @lrhn speculated (when looking at some similar code elsewhere in the SDK) that the check was inherited from the Dart 1.x days, when Dart\'s type system wasn\'t sound, so checking `if (position is! int)` was better because it caught all cases of passing a non-integer value to the function, not just nulls.  But since Dart 2.0, there\'s been no real benefit to using an `is` check to guard against null rather than an `== null` check, so it seems silly to go out of our way to document this scenario today.\r\n\r\nAll of the other examples in the SDK seem to be the same story.  So with *zero* realistic examples of this situation arising for anything other than `== null` and `!= null` comparisons, I\'m going to go out on a limb and say that our documentation should just address `== null` and `!= null` comparisons.  I suppose if we wanted to cover our bases really thoroughly we could always have a paragraph at the bottom that says ""similar issues can arise with `is` tests, `??`, `??=`, `?.` and `?..`"", but I suspect that would confuse more users than it helped.  @username_0 @username_2 @bwilkerson what do y\'all think?', 'title': None, 'type': 'comment'}

Specifically, I think we should say something like the following, which would be linked to from certain warnings around dead code/unnecessary casts, and is used to document the exception that is thrown by the inserted reachability guards.\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe Dart tools will issue warnings in code when you put null checks and a few other kinds of checks [footnote link here to small list of constructs?] that can never be needed in a null safe program.  [Small example here].  Since the variable in [reference to example] is declared non-nullable, it can never be `null` at runtime, and so the check here [reference to example] can never succeed in a fully null safe program.  However, because Dart supports running programs that are a mix of null safe and non-null safe code, a non-null safe part of the program can cause a `null` to appear where it would otherwise be impossible in a fully null safe program.  To guard against this, Dart will insert an assertion after checks like the one in [reference example here] or the cases below which will throw an exception if a null has snuck in from non null-safe code.  If you are seeing the [Insert name of exception here], this is because a null has been passed from non null safe code to one of these locations.  If for some reasons you feel that it is important to catch and handle a null value in such a location (even though in fully null safe code this check will be unnecessary), you can use the patterns described here [link to short description of patterns].\r\n```\r\n\r\nWDYT?', 'title': None, 'type': 'comment'}

username_0: Depending on how people will find/research these issues, this doc could be in one of two places:

* https://dart.dev/tools/diagnostic-messages (if people will find these issues only via static analysis).
* a new page that's similar to [Fixing common type problems](https://dart.dev/guides/language/sound-problems). diagnostic-messages would still have some info, but would link to this new page so that we don't document the fixes twice.

If we create a new page, we'll need a list of use cases, with before-and-after examples, to structure this page around.

/cc @bwilkerson @username_1
<issue_comment>username_1: Here's a concrete example of this (based on https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/painting/image_provider.dart).  @username_0 let me know if this is the kind of information you're looking for.  It's a real world example, with all the complexity that real world examples tend to entail, so feel free to adapt/simplify this example as needed.

Prior to migration the code looked like this:
```dart
  /// Fetches the image from the asset bundle, decodes it, and returns a
  /// corresponding [ImageInfo] object.
  ///
  /// This function is used by [load].
  @protected
  Future<ui.Codec> _loadAsync(AssetBundleImageKey key, DecoderCallback decode) async {
    ByteData data;
    // Hot reload/restart could change whether an asset bundle or key in a
    // bundle are available, or if it is a network backed bundle.
    try {
      data = await key.bundle.load(key.name);
    } on FlutterError {
      PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.evict(key);
      rethrow;
    }
    if (data == null) { // (1)
      PaintingBinding.instance.imageCache.evict(key);
      throw StateError('Unable to read data');
    }
    return await decode(data.buffer.asUint8List()); // (2)
  }
```

`key.bundle.load` is a method belonging to the Flutter framework that never returns `null`.  However, it might be overridden by a user-provided method, and that method might return null.  So Flutter has a defensive check at (1) to make sure that if that happens, (a) the key gets evicted from the image cache, and (b) the user gets a useful error message.  If they didn't have this defensive code, an exception would be thrown when `data` is accessed at (2), but it would be a less useful error message, and the key wouldn't be properly evicted from the image cache.

When migrating this code, the Flutter folks gave `key.bundle.load` a non-nullable return type, because it's never supposed to return `null`.  And they migrated the `_loadAsync` method like so:
```dart
  /// Fetches the image from the asset bundle, decodes it, and returns a
  /// corresponding [ImageInfo] object.
  ///
  /// This function is used by [load].
  @protected
  Future<ui.Codec> _loadAsync(AssetBundleImageKey key, DecoderCallback decode) async {
    ByteData? data;
    // Hot reload/restart could change whether an asset bundle or key in a
    // bundle are available, or if it is a network backed bundle.
    try {
      data = await key.bundle.load(key.name);
    } on FlutterError {
      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);
      rethrow;
    }
    if (data == null) { // (1)
      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);
      throw StateError('Unable to read data');
    }
    return await decode(data.buffer.asUint8List()); // (2)
  }
```

However, this created a problem.  Since `key.bundle.load` has a non-nullable return type, flow analysis reasons that when execution reaches (1), `data` will be non-null, so the body of the `if` statement is dead code; accordingly, the analyzer gives a hint.  Currently it gives a `dead_code` hint, but we're going to change it to something else so that the hint message can point the user to this mixed-mode unsoundness issue (https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/43452).  We might also change it to a warning rather than a hint.

Now, the analyzer says the body of the `if` statement is dead.  But is it really dead?  What if the user provides their own `key.bundle.load` method and it returns `null`?  If the user's code has null safety enabled, then that can't happen, because a method returning a non-nullable type can't be overridden by a method returning a nullable type.  But if the user's code *doesn't* have null safety enabled yet, there's nothing to stop their method from returning `null`.

We think it's really bad if the developer of a framework or package (like Flutter) thinks that a certain code path is impossible due to null safety, but it's actually possible if one of *their* users doesn't have null safety enabled.  So when the compiler compiles the above code, it actually treats it as though it were written like this (or at least, it will as soon as https://dart-review.googlesource.com/c/sdk/+/162004 lands):

```dart
  /// Fetches the image from the asset bundle, decodes it, and returns a
  /// corresponding [ImageInfo] object.
  ///
  /// This function is used by [load].
  @protected
  Future<ui.Codec> _loadAsync(AssetBundleImageKey key, DecoderCallback decode) async {
    ByteData? data;
    // Hot reload/restart could change whether an asset bundle or key in a
    // bundle are available, or if it is a network backed bundle.
    try {
      data = await key.bundle.load(key.name);
    } on FlutterError {
      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);
      rethrow;
    }
    if (data == null) { // (1)
      throw UnsoundnessError(); // *** ADDED BY THE COMPILER ***
      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);
      throw StateError('Unable to read data');
[Truncated]
      rethrow;
    }
    if ((data as dynamic) == null) { // (1)
      PaintingBinding.instance!.imageCache!.evict(key);
      throw StateError('Unable to read data');
    }
    return await decode(data.buffer.asUint8List()); // (2)
  }
```

Adding `as dynamic` hides the fact that `data` is non-nullable from flow analysis, so flow analysis no longer notices that it's dead code.  That means that the warning goes away, and the compiler stops inserting a `throw` statement.  So the Flutter developers get to keep their defensive code for the benefit of users that haven't started using null safety yet.

In the future, when we get to Dart 3.0 and null safety is required for all code, the defensive code will truly be dead and the Flutter developers will want to get rid of it.  When that happens, we intend to add a lint that will detect the `if ((data as dynamic) == null)` pattern, so that Flutter developers can find cases like this and remove them.

Ok! That's a long detailed example involving an `== null` check.  There are three other cases that could probably use discussion:
- `is` checks
- `??` and `??=` operations
- `?.` and `?..` operations

I'll dig around and try to find some real-world examples of those.  If I can't find any, we might have to make something up.
<issue_comment>username_0: That _is_ longer than I'd normally include in a doc page, but I suspect we can use it as the basis of a simpler example. I'm looking forward to the examples of the other 3 cases. Thanks, @username_1!
<issue_comment>username_1: Hmm, I'm having a lot of trouble finding examples in the other categories!  AFAICT, *all* of the instances of this issue in Flutter use `== null` or `!= null` checks.  I broadened my search to other packages that have been migrated so far, and again found nothing.

The only place where I've found examples that didn't involve `== null` or `!= null` checks is in the Dart SDK itself, and they're not very informative.  For example, this function from `sdk/lib/_internal/js_dev_runtime/private/native_typed_data.dart`:
```dart
void _invalidPosition(int position, int length, String name) {
  if (position is! int) {
    throw ArgumentError.value(position, name, 'Invalid list position');
  } else {
    throw RangeError.range(position, 0, length, name);
  }
}
```

The story is pretty much identical to the Flutter example I gave above, except that for some bizarre reason the code is using `if (position is! int)` to trigger the defensive code rather than `if (position == null)`.  Why?  I don't know.  @lrhn speculated (when looking at some similar code elsewhere in the SDK) that the check was inherited from the Dart 1.x days, when Dart's type system wasn't sound, so checking `if (position is! int)` was better because it caught all cases of passing a non-integer value to the function, not just nulls.  But since Dart 2.0, there's been no real benefit to using an `is` check to guard against null rather than an `== null` check, so it seems silly to go out of our way to document this scenario today.

All of the other examples in the SDK seem to be the same story.  So with *zero* realistic examples of this situation arising for anything other than `== null` and `!= null` comparisons, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that our documentation should just address `== null` and `!= null` comparisons.  I suppose if we wanted to cover our bases really thoroughly we could always have a paragraph at the bottom that says ""similar issues can arise with `is` tests, `??`, `??=`, `?.` and `?..`"", but I suspect that would confuse more users than it helped.  @username_0 @username_2 @bwilkerson what do y'all think?
<issue_comment>username_2: My general take on this is that while we may want some ""advanced mode"" docs for true power users, for most people a very simple example and a very simple explanation is warranted.  Specifically, I think we should say something like the following, which would be linked to from certain warnings around dead code/unnecessary casts, and is used to document the exception that is thrown by the inserted reachability guards.

```
The Dart tools will issue warnings in code when you put null checks and a few other kinds of checks [footnote link here to small list of constructs?] that can never be needed in a null safe program.  [Small example here].  Since the variable in [reference to example] is declared non-nullable, it can never be `null` at runtime, and so the check here [reference to example] can never succeed in a fully null safe program.  However, because Dart supports running programs that are a mix of null safe and non-null safe code, a non-null safe part of the program can cause a `null` to appear where it would otherwise be impossible in a fully null safe program.  To guard against this, Dart will insert an assertion after checks like the one in [reference example here] or the cases below which will throw an exception if a null has snuck in from non null-safe code.  If you are seeing the [Insert name of exception here], this is because a null has been passed from non null safe code to one of these locations.  If for some reasons you feel that it is important to catch and handle a null value in such a location (even though in fully null safe code this check will be unnecessary), you can use the patterns described here [link to short description of patterns].
```

WDYT?
<issue_comment>username_0: (I edited Leaf's comment so it was easier to read in the GitHub UI.)

Agreed, a simple example is probably what we want. We can point to more complex examples if necessary.

<issue_comment>username_2: FYI - We're currently pushing on an alternative approach that eliminates most of the user facing complexity described here, so this issue may be greatly downscoped.  Essentially, we will add an implicit `default` case with a `throw` to switches over non-nullable types which don't already have a default, and we will add an implicit `throw` after expression statements of type `Never` (e.g. calls to a function which claims to never return).

    try {
      data = await key.bundle.load(key.name);
    } on FlutterError {

<issue_comment>username_3: Taking a look at the discourse here and the current fleshed out state of the analyzer diagnostics and their related documentation, as well as the lack of further concern since null safety was released, I feel we can maybe close this issue.

If we still do want to add a small note or warning about migration somewhere, I appreciate @lrhn's suggestion of creating and using a consistent function across your codebase to handle this situation: https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/46907#issuecomment-900119629

His suggested function could also be expanded to accept an optional function for any extra behavior the caller may need.<issue_closed>"

username_0: 👋  I'm [Justin](https://www.justindorfman.com/). I am an Open Source sustainer, maintainer, and contributor. I currently work for [Sticker Mule](https://www.stickermule.com/uses/laptop-stickers) doing Developer Relations. They have been awesome enough to let me organize this event with @username_7 @whit537 @username_3 @username_4 @username_2 @alnermcgunn @username_6 & many others.

I look forward to meeting you all on the 19th. I also really love [our sponsors](https://sustainoss.org/sponsor/) for making this all happen.

How about you?
<issue_comment>username_1: Hey everyone 👋 I like to call myself community facilitator at [Hoodie](http://hood.ie/) – the friendly JavaScript backend for offline-first applications. Since the first day of Hoodie we were thinking about how to make the project sustain itself while remaining independent (including from [us](https://neighbourhood.ie)). We made some great progress but have a lot to figure out. We shared our thoughts at http://hood.ie/blog/sustaining-hoodie

I’m looking forward to meet you all in San Francisco on June 19th!
<issue_comment>username_2: 👋  I'm Ben, username_2 pretty much everywhere. I work with @username_3 as the product guy at Libraries.io, which came about through my work on protecting core internet infrastructure. I'm pretty focussed on supporting digital infrastructure-type projects, picking up on the work @username_17 did with Ford last year.
<issue_comment>username_3: Hi, I'm Andrew 👋 

I've been working on [Libraries.io](https://libraries.io) for the past couple years funded by Sloan and Ford Foundations, connecting the dots between open source projects and building tools on top of that data to help people discover, maintain and sustain open source software better.

Coming over to Sustain from the UK with @username_2 to see how we can best help find the open source projects that we as a community need to sustain the most and help support them better.

Also ask me about my miniature poodles!

<issue_comment>username_4: Jerod here 👋 

I make podcasts and stuff at [Changelog.com](https://changelog.com). We 💚 open source software and the people who create it, so helping out with Sustain was a no-brainer for me.

I'm excited to hang out and record some conversations with folks at the event so we can share our learnings and experiences with the greater community that cannot attend.
<issue_comment>username_5: 👋 

I am Kris Borchers, working for the [Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org) running the [JS Foundation](https://js.foundation). My focus is long-term sustainability for open source projects with a focus currently on the open source JavaScript ecosystem. Looking forward to great conversations!
<issue_comment>username_6: 👋  🐉  👋  Hey friends. I am [@richlitt](https://twitter.com/richlitt). I run maintainer.io (@mntnr), helping developers and companies maintain and scale out their open source code. I'm interested in alternative models for financing open source, and in helping out with a good work/life balance for those in open source. 

Looking forward to seeing you all in SF!
<issue_comment>username_7: Hi peeps! I'm Pia (@username_7) one of the founders of Open Collective. Previous life in civic tech, politics and democracy activism - which I still do! Working on building infrastructure for open collectives around the world to have economic power and a viable organizational scheme. Looking forward to connecting AFK with y'all. <3
<issue_comment>username_8: 👋  I'm Nate [@eigenjoy](https://twitter.com/eigenjoy) and a co-author of the books [Fullstack React](https://www.fullstackreact.com/), and [ng-book](https://www.ng-book.com/2/). Previously I worked at IFTTT.

I've been [thinking](https://twitter.com/eigenjoy/status/862412458517962752) [a lot](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14446871) about how we can better fund OSS. I believe that there is a lot of valuable software that isn't being written (or maintained) because none of the models are quite right.

If you write software that gets used, then it should be easy to get paid. But almost all of the current models require that you essentially take on a second job.

I've been toying with e.g. Bitcoin on and off since 2011 and I think that blockchain apps (obviously) have a role to play in this space. I'm working on a few ideas here that I'd love to chat about.

Looking forward to meeting you all!
<issue_comment>username_9: :wave: I'm Mikeal.

I've been a community organizer in Node.js since the early days. I helped start the Node.js Foundation lead it for the first few years.

I co-host a podcast with Nadia about Open Source Sustainability called [RFC](rfc.fm) and I write quite often about the subject [on Medium](https://medium.com/@username_9).
<issue_comment>username_10: Hi! I'm @gaba. I have been a software developer at The Coral Project for the last (almost) two years. We are working on open source tools to make and moderate comments as well as working on community around journalism. 

I'm very interested in different models of sustainability around open source projects as well as how to bring this into journalism.

username_0: ### Description of the problem
The site could use a redesign to help to streamline the content and the look and feel of the site to reflect more of the design of the application itself. The site should reflect more of the design of the application so they do not feel as separated. 

#### Type of problem?
Documentation issue | Content issue | Formatting issue | Design issue

Links to wireframes:
-Desktop: https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/7KOVWW4APV9#/screens
-Mobile: https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/K7PZLSMX3Q5#/screens/341026523_Mobile_Homepage

I've put together some wireframes for a proposed redesign of the site. I've included both desktop and mobile variations. Some of the main goals of the redesign included utilizing the newer branding to unify the site more with application, clean up the page layouts to be more consistent with one another, and update content so it's up to date. 

#### Help needed from anyone interested in contributing front end development (HTML & CSS, possibly Javascript).
<issue_comment>username_1: I commented on https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/7KOVWW4APV9#/screens.

Awesome work!
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 Awesome thank you for checking our the wireframes and leaving feedback!

<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Great thank you!
<issue_comment>username_3: Looks great to me
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 @username_2 I made some more updates to the wireframes based off of the feedback you left, feel free to check them out if you like.
<issue_comment>username_1: @username_0 looks much better now. I added some more comments on https://redhat.invisionapp.com/share/7KOVWW4APV9#/screens.
<issue_comment>username_2: thanks @username_0 that's much clearer and readable :-)
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_2 Great I'm glad to hear! @username_1 I added some more updates to the wireframes based off of the feedback you left, I updated the breadcrumbs across the board as well.
<issue_comment>username_3: looks good to me, @username_0  can you push this to production?
<issue_comment>username_4: just as a follow up @username_0 and I have a meeting scheduled this week to discuss this.
<issue_comment>username_4: hey @username_3 @username_2 I'm talking through requirements with @username_0. Just wondering how we want to move forward with this once I have some html/css ready for implementation?
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_4 I don't have a specific plan.
<issue_comment>username_0: Would it be helpful if we had a chat to figure out possible paths forward?
<issue_comment>username_0: Documentation solution must support asciidoc.
<issue_comment>username_3: @username_2 @gregsheremeta there was a plan to switch middleman to something which also support asciidoc, any update or ETA on that?
<issue_comment>username_2: The proposed solution is to use Jekyll. Several other communities have been using it for quite some time now and are happy with it, and we have al the deployment materials and knowledge to support it.

I checked and there's an asciidoc plugin.

Now converting to the new system is going to be some work. I can prepare a builder and test vhost but people are needed to actually port the content. Markdown is supported but some adaptation will probably be needed, as well as working together to polish the config (maybe find useful replcement plugins, get rid of the custom Ruby code…).

Also one step in that direction is moving the blog part to WP (see OVIRT-2652). Once done this part won't have to be ported to Jekyll. I'll ping Jason about it.
<issue_comment>username_1: We like markdown, and we don't want to learn complicated syntax that we don't need.

How new design related to changing the markup language and tools used to create the site? Can we implement the proposed design in the current system as is?
<issue_comment>username_4: @username_1 for the front end html/css it's going to be much easier to build from scratch but I'm not opposed to using the current structure. Whatever works!
<issue_comment>username_1: I'm not attached to the current system, just wanted to understand why site redesign proposal requires a rewrite :) Anyway If it is easier, replace special code standard tools, add features, and more fun, why not.
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_4 Do we want to get started on doing a preliminary look at the current code and seeing where we can go from there?
<issue_comment>username_0: @username_1 @username_3 @username_2 

We have a couple questions about next steps that I'm hoping you guys can help answer:

What will we build the site with (Jekyll?) and who will do this? 

From a content migration strategy perspective who will be doing this? If multiple teams have been involved in the past, who would be good to get in contact with? 

Do all the current pages on the site have 1:1 mapping with the new site? (I have to double check that the design covers the majority of page cases.) If not we'll want to make sure we cover broken links in search results.

Who would be a good contact/task owner for implementing the server side stuff? 

Let me know what you guys think!
<issue_comment>username_2: OSPO CommInfra

\\_o<
<issue_comment>username_0: Thank you for the input @username_2!

Great Jekyll sounds like a solid option then. 

Do you know if there's a specific contact person for oVirt on the OSPO team? Would it be helpful to reach out to them? For asking the community, we can send a message out on the community channels asking for feedback on it. 

@jasonbrooks Nice to meet you! Let me know if you need any UX support along the way. 

I can also reach out to OSPO CommInfra to ask them for their assistance for server side stuff.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_0 I'm in OSPO CommInfra
I'm just a secret oVirt Infra team operative too ;-P
<issue_comment>username_0: Perfect! Even better :)
<issue_comment>username_5: This was brought up by me and the RHV docs team. Support for Asciidoc is a must-have feature for us to establish some sport of content sharing between ovirt and downstream (where docs are written in Asciidoc), which is what many have been asking for.

If Jekyll can support both Markdown and Asciidoc, good. As for migrating ovirt guides that have RHV counterparts, I'd suggest we just reuse the current RHV 4.3 downstream content in Asciidoc instead of spending time migrating outdated ovirt docs in Markdown.
<issue_comment>username_2: @username_5 I totally agree this is a loss of energy but at the same time I think the ""upstream first"" pillar of Red Hat was lost somewhere in the process; so I guess convincing oVirt people should come first.

This is important because the theme will need to be ported to Jekyll, it should not be too difficult though.

Note that the request here is not to replace Markdown with AsciiDoc but to add AsciiDoc support in addition to Markdown, so I see no reason why not enable it.
